Posted in: Knowledge Posted by: Violet Manning Posted on: 07/02/2022 High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an analytical technique that separates components in a mixture to determine what substances are present. Not only can you see what is in a mixture, but you can also use HPLC systems to determine the quantities of each substance too, giving an accurate view of your sample. How does HPLC work? In HPLC, a liquid sample is injected into a solvent stream, known as the mobile phase, which flows through a column packed with a stationary phase. A high-pressure pump controls the flow of the mobile phase, while an injector introduces the sample into this stream. As the sample travels through the column, its components separate based on their interactions with the mobile and stationary phases. This separation process allows different substances in the mixture to be identified. A detector then captures the eluted compounds, providing essential data for further analysis. How does HPLC work to separate components of a mixture? Normal phase HPLC Normal phase chromatography uses polar compounds for the stationary phase (e.g. silica particles) while the mobile phase is non-polar (e.g. hexane). In this type of chromatographic analysis, sample components are separated based on how much they interact with the polar stationary phase. In simple terms, the higher the polarity of a substance, the slower it will move through the column. Therefore, more polar compounds will have a slower flow rate and non-polar molecules will have a quicker flow rate. This happens because, during normal phase elution, the polar compounds in the stationary phase strongly attract other polar compounds in the sample, and the non-polar compounds in the mobile phase attract the non-polar compounds in the sample mixture. Then, using the measured flow rates, we can determine what molecules are present in the sample mixture based on what we know about the polarity and flow rate of existing substances. Reversed-phase HPLC In contrast to normal phase HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC has a non-polar stationary phase using modified silica particles and a polar mobile phase, typically a mixture of water and an organic solvent like methanol. This means the movement of highly polar compounds through the column is faster than molecules with lower polarity – the opposite of in normal phase HPLC, hence the name reversed-phase HPLC. You may be wondering why there’s a need for reversed-phase HPLC if it’s just the opposite of normal phase HPLC, but the reason is quite simple. Reversed-phase HPLC is more replicable and therefore more reliable than normal phase HPLC, both of which are fundamental parts of scientific research. How to interpret results from high-performance liquid chromatography After the sample mixture has passed through the HPLC column, the separated compounds reach the detector. While there are many different detection methods, the fundamental job of the detector is to indicate how long it takes the molecules to elute and the respective concentration. This is visualised in a graph, also known as a chromatogram. On a chromatogram, the X-axis indicates the time it took for the substance to reach the detector (also known as retention time). The Y-axis indicates the detector response (i.e. how much the molecule interacts with the detector). The exact meaning of the Y-axis will depend on the detection method used, for example, if a UV detector is used, the Y-axis will show how much ultraviolet light is absorbed by the molecule in question. Thanks to the chromatogram, we know the retention time and detector response of each compound in the sample, which can be compared to the properties of known compounds to identify the various components in the sample. Finally, we can work out the concentration of each substance using the area under the curve on the chromatogram – the larger the area under the curve, the higher the concentration of that substance. How does HPLC separation compare to Gas Chromatography? We know that HPLC separation occurs based on the interaction between the compound with the stationary and mobile phases, but in a gas chromatographic analysis, separation occurs based on the volatility of each compound. Gas chromatography still uses stationary and mobile phases like HPLC, but the mobile phase is typically an unreactive or inert gas that is unlikely to absorb other substances, like hydrogen. The stationary phase is usually tiny silica particles or another chemical that selectively attracts a certain molecule. This means fewer volatile molecules will move slowly through the column as they interact with the stationary phase more, while more volatile molecules move faster through the column with the mobile phase. Keep equipment working effectively When equipment is in full working order, it’s relatively straightforward to identify compounds using chromatography techniques. However, if your equipment is poorly maintained, you may find the results of your analysis are skewed, therefore compounds can’t be identified correctly. LC Services stock a wide range of chromatography equipment and parts to ensure your analyses are as accurate and reliable as possible. We also offer a range of service contracts to highlight issues as soon as possible to reduce costs and bring you peace of mind that your lab is running at peak performance.

Protocol Optimization, Strategies & Decisions: Making the Most of Your SAD/MAD Studies Date: May 20, 2024 Categories: Early Phase Clinical Trials, Clinical Research Organization By: Lona Sheeran, SVP, Clinical Operations, Early Phase In the dynamic world of drug development, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) studies play a pivotal role in establishing the safety and efficacy of new therapeutics. These initial trials are critical, as they lay the groundwork for subsequent phases and can accelerate the drug discovery timeline when executed properly. But are you making the most out of your SAD/MAD protocols? This blog delves into the essential strategies for mastering SAD/MAD trial design, highlights critical insights gleaned from success stories in the field, and discusses how to optimize early phase trials to ensure rapid yet safe drug development. Understanding SAD and MAD Studies Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Studies focus on understanding how the body tolerates a single dose of a drug. They involve gradually increasing the dose among different groups of participants to establish the trial drug’s safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Multiple Ascending Dose (M AD) Studies extend this evaluation to repeated dosing, assessing the effects of drug accumulation and the body’s response to prolonged exposure. This type of evaluation helps in understanding the drug’s behavior over time, which is crucial for determining suitable dosing schedules. Challenges and Complexities of Phase 1 Protocols Subject clinical staff burden : Designs demanding excessive or invasive procedures can deter participant cooperation and overwhelm clinical staff, jeopardizing data integrity. Avoiding excessive data collection : Balancing thoroughness and excessive data collection is critical. Excessive data increases the chances of potentially compromised data integrity and adds unnecessary work for clinical staff. High chance for error rates and poor data quality : Without careful protocol design, error rates could increase and overshadow your primary objective. Unforeseen study delays can lead to delayed submissions and put the development behind schedule. While difficult to predict, having a general plan for if an unforeseen delay occurs will help foster smoother navigation and get your study back on track as soon as possible. Strategies and Decisions for Protocol Optimization Are timelines critical? If so, it is possible to overlap MAD and SAD cohorts, leading with SAD and then MAD. However, doing so requires additional caution, PK analysis after each cohort, and careful design. Is your priority selling the compound right after SAD/MAD completion? If so, consider adding Food Effect (FE) to your SAD/MAD protocol to garner useful information about your compound.  If your investigational product causes GI issues, it would be good to know if dosing in a fed state would help alleviate some Adverse Events as you navigate your subsequent studies.  Moreover, some scenarios benefit from incorporating an epTQT into the protocol to study the potential effect on cardiac repolarization, a critical component of early phase drug safety testing. In preclinical studies, if there are no hERG signaling abnormalities, epTQT is recommended, as it shows an increased chance for cardiac safety.  This cardiac data can be helpful as you progress your compound through other studies. You can collect, store, and analyze later if needed.  Some companies have successfully gotten a “waiver,” so they don’t have to run a thorough TQT study in later development. When Is It Worthwhile to Add Patient or Population-Specific Cohorts for Early Efficacy? Phase 1 protocols are complicated, and adding more complications may not be necessary unless targeting a specific indication. In such cases, the data could add value to the buyer and expedite the process. Including early efficacy, cohorts can complicate protocol design and study execution while significantly extending SAD/MAD timelines in your trial. You need to evaluate the balance of adding in a patient cohort and potentially extending timelines. Lessons Learned from Previous Experiences Sponsor A set up a SAD in a hybrid “normal healthy/ patient population” and then moved to pure patients for MAD. While the design was scientifically clean, the sponsor experienced unexpected SAD participant recruitment difficulties, delaying MAD progress. This sponsor’s experiences highlight the importance of partnering with a CRO experienced in recruitment strategies with patient populations and normal healthy volunteers with a track record of success. Sponsor B successfully ran SAD and MAD in a normal healthy volunteer (HV) population and included the final two cohorts of MAD in patients with a specific rare disease within their protocol. This highlights the potential use case for using patient cohorts for early efficacy and makes your asset more attractive to buyers. Sponsor C successfully ran SAD and MAD in a normal HV population and opted to run the last two MAD cohorts in a disease population, which then directly transitioned into an open-label extension (OLE) for the trial. This innovative protocol design emphasizes the use case of using OLE in a SAD/MAD. This unique strategy helped recruit a patient population. Sponsor D ran their SAD and MAD in the full HV population without including any patient populations. However, their protocol had six primary objectives and three secondary objectives. This complexity created ambiguity as to the real aim of the study. All these objectives included many procedures that created a high subject burden resulting in subjects losing interest in this study due to the level of commitment needed. Looking Ahead to Your Next Study Protocol Design When planning your next SAD/MAD study, it is important to consider some key factors that will collectively reduce friction and increase your trial’s capacity. For example, consider protocol timelines and how they are impacted by adding patient or specialized populations (obese, elderly, or post-menopausal women) to the SAD/MAD. You may also want to consider separating your SAD and MAD into two separate protocols. This allows you to database lock and unblind your SAD while your MAD is still ongoing. This may give insight and change how you want to run your MAD trial. To ensure better odds of success, plan your design to be aligned with clinical design basics, including only two primary objectives, a maximum of two secondary, and an exploratory objective, if needed. Selecting a CRO and Implementing the Protocol In general, when choosing the best CRO fit for your study, we recommend the following: Keep the SAD or MAD in a single protocol; if this is not possible, we highly recommend awarding both SAD and MAD to the same CRO. Select an experienced CRO with a successful track record of HV, patient, and specialized population recruitment. A CRO with an on-site manufacturing pharmacy for all your Phase 1 needs. Doing so avoids the need for 3rd party CGMP facility, associated costs, and increased time for production. The clinical Research Unit can make quick changes in dosage on-site during your study. If using a Clinical Research Unit with an on-site manufacturing suite, less stability time is needed. IP can be made and given to subjects within hours. Optimizing SAD and MAD studies is about strategically enhancing every aspect of the trial from planning through execution to ensure safety, efficiency, and regulatory compliance. By understanding and implementing optimization strategies, you can significantly improve the outcomes of early phase clinical trials, paving the way for safer and more effective therapeutic solutions.

Post author By MTS Post date 7 March 2022 Categories In Articles , MTS Helpdesk , Resource Library LinkedIn Tweet Facebook Email MTS Helpdesk Question: How long does it take to equilibrate a column on an HPLC system before the first injection can be performed? Answer: This is a question commonly asked by HPLC analysts, particularly those relatively new to the technique. The range of currently available column dimensions means that a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate. The amount of mobile phase which should be flushed through a column before it is ready to use is usually expressed in terms of the column volume, the amount of mobile phase required to fill the column. When a column has just been installed on a reversed phase HPLC system then it will typically require between 10 and 20 column volumes before it is fully equilibrated and ready to use. However, some applications are likely to require additional column volumes. Examples are methods which include ion-pairing reagents and chiral HPLC methods. In these cases suitable equilibration should be investigated and documented for future use. A starting point for investigation may be approximately 30 column volumes. When re-equilibrating after a gradient injection has been run (prior to the next injection) 10 column volumes is recommended. Although we refer to the column volume, the volume that we are interested in is more correctly called the void volume, Vm. This is the volume of the HPLC column that is not taken up by the stationary phase. This is typically approximately 70% of the total column volume. There are two methods that you can use to calculate the void volume. Method 1 Use the dimensions of the column and the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The dimensions of interest on a HPLC column are shown in Figure 1 below. The result of the calculation above is the total column volume. To convert this value to the void volume we multiply by 70%, therefore the formula becomes: The radius, r, is equal to the internal diameter divided by two: Example A HPLC column of internal diameter 4.6mm and length 10cm: Note: express both i.d. and length in cm. To calculate the required equilibration time simply multiply the calculated void volume (in mL) by the number of required column volumes, e.g. 10, then divide by the flow rate (in mL/min)to determine the total time required. For a flow rate of 1 mL/min on the column above, this would result in an equilibration time of 11.6 minutes for 10 column volumes. Method 2 Inject an unretained solute to obtain t0, the column dead time (minutes). Then multiply this by the flow rate to obtain the void volume: Where F is the flow rate expressed in mL/min. Example The flow rate for the method is 1.0 mL/min. The column dead time, t0, is obtained from the chromatogram in Figure 2 and is equal to 1.05 minutes. Therefore, Vm = 1.0 x 1.05 = 1.05mL As previously, to calculate the required equilibration time you can multiply the calculated void volume (in mL) by the number of required column volumes, e.g. 10, then divide by the flow rate (in mL/min) to determine the total time required. However, you can see that we multiplied by the flow rate and then divided by the flow rate. The purpose of this was to show the principle of the calculation and compare to method 1. In fact, the required equilibration time is just t0 multiplied by the number of column volumes required. In this example, the equilibration time is simply 1.05 x 10 = 10.5 minutes.

Ba(OH) 2 → BaO + H 2 O Reactions of barium hydroxide with ammonium salts are strongly endothermic. The reaction of barium hydroxide octahydrate with ammonium chloride or ammonium thiocyanate is often used as a classroom chemistry demonstration, producing temperatures cold enough to freeze water and enough water to dissolve the resulting mixture. Barium hydroxide is occasionally used in organic synthesis as a strong base, for example for the hydrolysis of esters and nitriles, and as a base in aldol condensations. It can be used to perform decarboxylation of amino acids. Barium hydroxide is often used in ketonic decarboxylations for the preparation of various organic compound, like cyclopentanone from adipic acid [2] or in aldol reactions like in the preparation of diacetone alcohol from acetone . [3] Physical Barium hydroxide is a colorless solid, slightly soluble in cold water, but more soluble in hot water. As barium carbonate is insoluble in water, clear solutions of barium hydroxide are free of any carbonates (but they go turbid quickly as they absorb carbon dioxide from the air). This property allows the use of barium hydroxide to be used in titration of acids using indicators such as phenolphthalein or thymolphthalein (with alkaline color changes) without the risk of titration errors due to the presence of carbonate ions, which are much less basic. Availability Barium hydroxide is sold by chemical suppliers. Preparation Barium hydroxide can be prepared by dissolving barium oxide (BaO) in water: BaO + H 2 O → Ba(OH) 2 The reaction is exothermic, and the heat produced may even melt the octahydrate. It crystallizes as the octahydrate from water, which converts to the monohydrate upon heating in air above 78 °C. If heated above 100 °C in a vacuum, the monohydrate will yield Ba(OH) 2 and water. [4] [5] A simple route involves the double displacement of barium chloride with sodium hydroxide . Both solutions should be warmed before being mixed and hot filtered to remove small amounts of barium carbonate. BaCl 2 + 2 NaOH + 8 H 2 O → 2 NaCl + Ba(OH) 2 ·8H 2 O ↓ Another possible preparation route, taking advantage of its moderate water solubility, involves the double displacement reaction of barium acetate and potassium hydroxide , reaction which takes place at high temperatures (60-80 °C). As the solution cools, the less soluble barium hydroxide precipitates out of the solution, while the much more soluble potassium acetate stays in solution. Ba(CH 3 COO) 2 + 2 KOH + 8 H 2 O → 2 CH 3 COOK + Ba(OH) 2 ·8H 2 O ↓ Projects Make barium salts Titration of acids Chemical demonstrations of endothermic reactions Ketonic decarboxylations Handling Safety Barium hydroxide is toxic if ingested, as it reacts with stomach acid to form the more soluble barium chloride . In case of ingestion, a non-toxic soluble sulfate solution (like sodium or magnesium sulfate) can be used as antidote. Storage Should be kept in air-tight plastic bottles. Disposal Can be mixed with a sulfate, to yield the insoluble barium sulfate, which is non-toxic. References Jump up ↑ Rabinovich V.A., Khavin Z.Ya.

By differentiating the ideal gas equation PV = nRT, we get: By substituting the adiabatic relation (Equation 1) into the right hand side of the equation above, we get: Rearranging, Integrating both sides of the equation, we obtain: Hence, Substitute in the ideal gas law and you get the other forms, Adiabatic ideal gas process Equation of the adiabat (line of constant ) Adiabatic work done by the gas, Next: Isochoric Process & Isobaric Process Previous: Isothermal Process Back To Thermodynamics Back To Thermodynamics (University Year 1 Physics) Back To University Year 1 Physics Notes Categories Thermodynamics , University , Year 1 Tags Mini Physics As the Administrator of Mini Physics, I possess a BSc.

Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer with a very poor prognosis of survival.  Causes of glioblastoma are not known, and there is no method for preventing the cancer.  Traditional treatment includes the drug temozolomide (TMZ).  In many cases, TMZ kills glioblastoma cells, but a significant portion of patients show resistance to the drug.  Changes in the levels of metabolites — small molecules playing key roles in metabolic processes in living organisms — have been observed in TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells, pointing to the importance of understanding and targeting metabolic pathways in the context of cancer therapy.  Now, Atushi Hirao from Kanazawa University and colleagues have investigated the role of lysosomes — cellular organelles that break down biomolecules no longer needed — in metabolic processes linked to the development of glioblastoma.  Based on their findings, they propose a targeted lysosomal dysfunction strategy for the treatment of glioblastoma. Lysosomes perform important biochemical functions.  Apart from degrading ‘waste’ biopolymers, they are involved in cell signaling and energy flow and interact with other organelles.  As such, they are also relevant for the development and growth of cancer.  Hirao and colleagues first checked whether lysosome activity is an indicator of glioblastoma progression.  They looked at glioblastoma cell lines taken from patients and found a correlation between lysosomal activity and glioblastoma tumorigenesis and malignancy. The researchers then investigated how lysosomal activity affects the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ.  They found that when administering lysosomal inhibitors, the sensitivity of glioblastoma to TMZ increased, confirming the critical role played by lysosomes in glioblastoma.  Further experiments pointed to a protein called transcription factor E3 (TFE3) as a crucial molecule for maintaining lysosomal function, and TMZ tolerance, in glioblastoma cells. The scientists then studied which amino acids are essential for lysosomal activity in the context of glioblastoma progression.  They discovered a correlation between lysine and glioblastoma malignancy.  Lysine is not produced by the human body; it must be obtained through nutrition.  Hirao and colleagues therefore considered whether a lysine-restricted diet could be a therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.  They pointed out that, while lysine restriction might be a possible approach, it has limited practical use because of toxicity concerns – the human body needs lysine as a precursor to vital proteins. Instead, the researchers worked out an alternative approach mimicking the effect of lysine restriction.  Realizing that one of lysine’s functions is to antagonize the effect of arginine, which plays a role in the biosynthesis of nitric oxide, they tested the use of homoarginine, an antagonist of lysine —  that is, inhibiting lysine’s function — to counteract lysine’s blocking of nitric oxide production from arginine, and induce lysosomal dysfunction.  Experiments with mice showed that the combination of TMZ and homoarginine led to a significant suppression of glioblastoma cells, demonstrating its potential therapeutic value (Figure). The work of Hirao and colleagues highlights the critical role of lysosomal function in glioblastoma pathogenesis, and how mimicking lysin restriction may play a role in anticancer strategies.  Quoting the researchers: “… disrupting lysosomal function may provide a promising avenue for glioblastoma therapy.” Background Glioblastoma Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer.  It starts with the growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord.  The cancer grows quickly and can destroy healthy tissue.  Although glioblastoma can happen at all ages, it tends to occur more in older adults.  Symptoms include headaches, vomiting, nausea, blurred or double vision, difficulty with speaking, an altered sense of touch, and seizures.  There is no cure for glioblastoma; treatments can slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms. Lysosome Lysosomes are organelles, enclosed by membranes, located within cells.  They contain many types of enzymes (bioproteins with a catalytic function) that assist in breaking down many kinds of biopolymers, such as proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.  As such, lysosomes serve as the ‘digestive system’ of the cell, degrading material from both within and outside of the cell.  Lysosomes also serve as signaling hubs, lying at the junction of many metabolic pathways.  Recent research has revealed that lysosomes play important roles in cancer development.  Detailed understanding of metabolic pathways in the lysosome may help unlock its therapeutic potential.  Atsushi Hirao from Kanazawa University and colleagues have now identified a particular lysosome function that is critical for the resistance of glioblastoma cells to the drug temozolomide, a finding that holds promise for anticancer therapies based on lysosome dysfunction.

Email: higuchi@fmu.ac.jp . Abstract: We sometimes encounter patients with chronic empyema of their thoracic cavity with or without air leakage. These patients often experience mental and physical problems because of restrictions in daily life and long-term treatment. Thoracic empyema is classified as acute or chronic empyema. The former is treated by antibiotics, thoracic drainage, fibrinolysis, or debridement under video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), while the latter is treated by managing the infection and reducing the dead space of the thoracic cavity. In this review, we summarize the procedures for various treatment methods and technical skills in the management of thoracic empyema. Chest physicians should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method and choose an appropriate technique or possibly a combination of techniques to obtain an optimal outcome in the treatment of thoracic empyema. The techniques and knowledge described in this review will be useful for many physicians’ clinical work. Treatment methods differ among institutions, and a guideline for thoracic empyema is needed to standardize treatment of this entity in future. Keywords: Empyema ; chest drainage ; fibrinolysis ; video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) ; open surgery Received: 23 January 2020; Accepted: 27 February 2020; Published: 25 November 2020. doi: 10.21037/ccts.2020.02.09 Introduction Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Thoracic empyema, which is defined as purulent collections within the thoracic cavity due to a pleural space infection, is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in both adults and children despite optimal treatment ( 1 - 4 ). This entity was first described in the fifth century B.C. by Hippocrates in his aphorisms, who proposed drainage as a treatment ( 5 ). For hundreds of years thereafter, empyema was treated using open drainage. However, most cases are now initially treated using antibiotics with or without repeated thoracentesis or tube drainage. Surgical approaches including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open thoracotomy are usually reserved for patients with a deteriorated clinical condition following failed conservative treatment. VATS has been shown to result in earlier and more complete resolution of empyema than tube drainage alone ( 6 , 7 ). Fibrinolysis has also been shown to be superior to tube drainage alone ( 8 - 10 ). The management of thoracic empyema is empirical, and its treatment strategy is controversial. Furthermore, limited data from controlled clinical trials are available to guide the management of thoracic empyema. This review highlights significant findings in empyema management to help readers comprehend the current status of this field. Epidemiology Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Recent epidemiologic studies have indicated that the incidence of empyema has been increasing during the last few decades ( 11 ). In 2016 in Japan, 2,833 cases of empyema were reported and hospital mortality rate was 6.9% ( 12 ). In the United Sates, the estimated incidence of parapneumonic empyema is 6 cases per 100,000 people, and the hospital mortality rate in the adult population is approximately 16.1% ( 13 ). Risk factors of empyema include diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux, poor dental hygiene, chronic lung disease, alcohol abuse, and so on. Empyema may develop as a complication of pulmonary infection, thoracic and abdominal surgery, trauma, and iatrogenic procedures. However, pleural infection may also occur as a primary infection without pneumonia. Pathophysiology and classification Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Acute empyema Thoracic empyema is the accumulation of purulent collections within the pleural cavity. Empyema is classified as acute or chronic and is also classified as localized or diffuse. Empyema is divided into three stages ( 14 ): stage I is an acute exudative phase in which the visceral pleura remains elastic and the dimensions of the thoracic cavity are maintained. Stage II is a subacute fibrinopurulent phase characterized by turbid, infected fluid with fibrin deposits constructing bridges that separate the effusions. Stage III is chronic organizing phase in which this construct is replaced by formal granulation tissue. Successful treatment of acute empyema requires immediate treatment with adequate antibiotics and tube drainage to prevent recurrence and chronicity. Most affected patients have small and uncomplicated effusion that can be treated conservatively with continued antibiotics, thoracentesis and observation. However, patients with loculated pleural effusion or purulent effusion on thoracentesis should be considered prompt insertion of a chest tube. Patients with loculated parapneumonic effusion (stage II, subacute phase), particularly those patients whose lung fails to re-expand, should be considered for early VATS procedure or intrapleural fibrinolytics ( 15 , 16 ). Chronic empyema Empyema lasting ≥4 weeks is classified as chronic empyema ( 17 ). At stage III empyema, the cloudy fluid begins to organize and form granulation tissue. The continuous inflammation of the infectious process involves in the formation of a fibrin peel on the visceral and parietal pleural surface. Continuation of this process also contributes contraction of the affected thorax in addition to a mediastinal shift toward the affected side and rib space narrowing. In general, chronic empyema is characterized by thickened visceral and parietal fibrin peels that hamper the ability of the affected lung to re-expand. At stage III empyema, chest tube drainage is no longer effective, therefore, chronic condition of pleural cavity needs surgical procedure. The purpose of surgical treatment is to remove purulent effusion, infected tissue and thickened pleura, and finally to close the empyema space to avoid recurrence. The selection of the initial treatment depends on the conditions of the patient’s pleural cavity and lung parenchyma. Classification by American Thoracic Society The American Thoracic Society proposed a classification system in 1962 based on the natural history of empyema ( Table 1 ) ( 14 ). In this classification, empyema is divided into three stages: exudative phase, fibrinopurulent phase and organized phase. The exudative phase lasts for several days and is characterized by a free-moving effusion in the pleural space. The fibrinopurulent phase is characterized by a reduced intrapleural fibrinolysis that causes fibrin deposition on the visceral and parietal pleura and is also characterized by a cloudy, viscous fluid. The organized phase is characterized by the fibrin and collagen deposition, resulting in fibrous thickening of the pleura. This classification is useful in practice and is still employed because the method of treatment is totally different in each stage or phase. Table 1 Three-stage classification by the American Thoracic Society Exudative phase (stage I) Fibrinopurulent phase (stage II) Organized phase (stage III) Characteristics of pleural effusion or pus Inflammatory processes extend to the pleura and result in immediate outpouring of fluid Frank pus accumulates especially laterally and dorsally Thick and sedimented exudate Pathophysiology of pleural effusion and pleura Low cell content High cell content and fibrin depositions over the pleural surfaces and fibrinous strands within the fluid Fibroblast growth and fibrosis Intrathoracic condition Re-expandable lung Tendency for development of loculations and formations of membranes Inelastic membranes over the pleural surfaces Beginning constriction of the lung Trapped lung Light’s classification According to Light ( 18 ), thoracic empyema is classified into seven categories as shown in Table 2 . This classification has four variables: fluid bacteriology, fluid property, fluid chemistry, and fluid pH. According to this classification, a typical parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the thickness of the pleural fluid is >10 mm, the pleural glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, the pleural fluid pH is >7.20, the pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration is <1,000 IU/L, and Gram stain and culture are negative. A borderline complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the pleural fluid pH is 7.00 to 7.20, the pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration is >1,000 IU/L, the pleural fluid glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, and Gram stain and culture are negative. A simple complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the pleural fluid pH is <7.00, the pleural fluid glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, and Gram stain is positive; however, the fluid is not loculated and does not appear to be frank pus. A complex complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the criteria for a simple complicated parapneumonic effusion with multiloculation of the pleural fluid. In a simple empyema, the pleural fluid is frank pus and the fluid is free-flowing without loculi. If the pleural fluid is frank pus and the fluid is multiloculated, these conditions are called to have complex empyema. This classification is widely accepted and is useful for physicians to choose the optimal treatment of thoracic empyema because each classification recommends a therapeutic option. Table 2 Light’s classification Class Characteristics of effusion Bacteriology Imaging findings Biochemistry pH Treatment Class 1 Nonsignificant parapneumonic effusion Gram stain and culture negative <10 mm thick on decubitus X-ray – – No thoracentesis indicated Class 2 Typical parapneumonic effusion Gram stain and culture negative >10 mm thick Glucose >40 mg/dL pH >7.20 Antibiotics alone Class 3 Borderline complicated parapneumonic effusion Gram stain and culture negative Not loculated, no frank pus Glucose >40 mg/dL, LDH >1,000 IU/L 7.00< pH <7.20 Antibiotics plus serial thoracentesis Class 4 Simple complicated parapneumonic effusion Gram stain and culture positive Not loculated, no frank pus Glucose <40 mg/dL pH <7.00 Tube thoracotomy plus antibiotics Class 5 Complex complicated parapneumonic effusion Gram stain and culture positive Multiloculated Glucose <40 mg/dL pH <7.00 Tube thoracotomy plus thrombolytics Class 6 Simple empyema Frank pus present Single locule or free-flowing – – Tube thoracotomy ± decortication Class 7 Complex empyema Frank pus present Multiple locules – – Tube thoracotomy plus thrombolytics; VATS or decortication often required LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; VATS, video-assisted thoracic surgery. Guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians The American College of Chest Physicians proposed guidelines on the medical and surgical treatment of parapneumonic effusions in 2000 ( 19 ). This guideline has three variables: pleural space anatomy, pleural fluid bacteriology, and pleural fluid chemistry. These variables are used to categorize patients into four separate risk levels: category 1 (very low-risk), category 2 (low-risk), category 3 (moderate-risk), and category 4 (high-risk) ( Table 3 ). Table 3 Categorization of risk for poor outcome among patients with parapneumonic effusion and empyema by the American College of Chest Physicians Category Risk of poor outcome Pleural space anatomy Pleural fluid bacteriology Pleural fluid chemistry Drainage 1 Very low A0: Minimal, free-flowing effusion (<10 mm on lateral decubitus view) and Bx: Culture and Gram stain results unknown and Cx: pH unknown No 2 Low A1: Small to moderate free-flowing effusion (>10 mm and less than one-half hemithorax) and B0: Negative culture and Gram stain and C0: pH ≥7.20 No 3 Moderate A2: Large, free-flowing effusion (at least one-half hemithorax) loculated effusion, or effusion with thickened parietal pleura or B1: Positive culture and Gram stain or C1: pH <7.20 Yes 4 High – – B2: Pus – – Yes Diagnostic methods Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Imaging A staging assessment based mainly on the start of symptoms is not easily implemented in some cases. A chest roentgenogram, ultrasound examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) scan are all required and are considered as the primary imaging modalities for effusion ( 20 ). Imaging plays three important roles in empyema management: confirmation and characterization of effusions; decision for treatment, including thoracentesis, drainage, and surgical interventions; and follow-up of the patients after treatment. Chest roentgenogram Imaging techniques play a fundamental role in the management of empyema. In spite of advances in imaging modalities, the chest X-ray still plays a basic role in establishing the presence and amount of pleural effusion and guiding management during follow-up of patients. Asymmetric pleural effusion with blunting of the costophrenic angle can be recognized and smaller-volume effusions are detectable with a lateral-view roentgenogram. Chest CT Chest CT with intravenous contrast is optimal and has high diagnostic yield for empyema. Furthermore, a CT scan provides additional information about detailed anatomy including the mediastinum and hila. A CT scan is also necessary in some cases to confirm the characteristics of the effusion, determine the presence of pleural thickening or adhesions, and identify associated lesions such as tumors ( 21 ). Ultrasonography Ultrasound is an accessible, radiation-free method of visualizing free versus loculated pleural effusions. A previous study showed that ultrasound had better sensitivity for diagnosing pleural effusion than did plain radiographs ( 22 ). In the absence of clear loculation on ultrasonography, simple thoracentesis or chest tube drainage can be the standard treatment; however, patients with clear loculation require a form of thoracoscopy as an initial treatment ( 23 ). Thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis Diagnostic thoracentesis is crucial to demonstrate the presence of pus, which identifies the empyema. Additionally, pleural fluid sampling via thoracentesis is needed for fluid analysis and diagnosis of pleural effusion ( 20 ). For patients with a known pleural infection, intercostal drainage is required for appropriate treatment, and thoracentesis without pleural tube drainage is not recommended ( 24 ). Patients with empyema who have non-purulent pleural fluid with a low pH or glucose concentration can be managed with antibiotics alone ( 25 , 26 ). However, most patients who have purulent collections in their pleural cavity require VATS or open thoracotomy ( 27 ). Light ( 18 ) proposed a classification system that assists the physician in determining the aggressiveness of the initial therapy. We have described the details of this classification in the previous section of this review. Treatment modalities Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Antibiotics Although the choice of antibiotics should be essentially on the basis of culture in pleural effusion, antibiotic therapy is started empirically; in only a minority of cases is the antibiotic therapy adapted to the laboratory results because of the low rate of positive bacteriology results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for most patients with suspected or confirmed thoracic empyema. Antibiotics should be tailored to target pathogens based on epidemiology, antibiotic resistance patterns, cause of acquisition, and whether the affected patients are from a community versus healthcare setting. In community-acquired empyema, the antibiotic regimen should target common pathogens including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Appropriate antibiotics include a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination. In hospital-acquired empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be directed at providing coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas . Reasonable options include vancomycin plus metronidazole and antipseudomonal cephalosporin. Intravenous administration of antibiotics is often appropriate initially; however, the administration route can be changed to oral when objective clinical (e.g., improvement in temperature) and biochemical improvement (e.g., C-reactive protein) has been observed. Continuation of antibiotic therapy is generally recommended for 2 to 6 weeks depending on the degree of aforementioned infection and clinical response to the treatment ( 28 ). Chest tube drainage A poor response to antibiotics is requires chest tube drainage. The optimal size of the chest tube and duration of tube drainage are not determined. A large multicenter study on the chest drain diameter in the treatment of plural infection showed no significant differences in any impairment in clinical outcome except insertion discomfort between small- and large-diameter drains ( 29 ). Clinically, the location of the chest tube is more relevant than the tube size, and inappropriate positioning of the chest tube can cause treatment failure. The appropriate removal time of the chest tube depends on two factors: radiological confirmation of successful pleural drainage and objective evidence of infection resolution. However, the presence of loculations frequently makes the effusion difficult to discharge from pleural cavity with chest tube drainage. In the situation, intrapleural fibrinolysis, VATS, or open surgery is needed. Fibrinolysis Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy was first reported in the late 1940s. Tillett and Sherry ( 30 ) used a partially purified streptococcal concentrate containing streptokinase and streptococcal deoxyribonuclease (DNase) intrapleurally in patients with fibrinopurulent pleura and empyema. To date, 11 randomized controlled trials have been performed since 2000, including both adults and children ( Table 4 ). Of these trials, the largest are Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trials 1 and 2 (MIST-1 and MIST-2) ( 31 , 41 ). MIST-1 showed that streptokinase at 250,000 IU twice daily for 3 days increased the amount of pleural fluid drainage, however, which was not associated with reduced mortality, lower surgical referral, or duration of hospital stay ( 41 ). MIST-2 was a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial for adult patients with pleural infection ( 34 ). This study showed that combined intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/DNase resulted in a significant reduction of pleural effusion in radiograph, a lower frequency of surgery, and decreased duration of hospital stay compared with placebo.

MIST, Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial. Streptokinase The most commonly used fibrinolytic in the clinical setting is streptokinase, and several prospective studies have proven the efficacy of this agent for thoracic empyema ( Table 4 ) ( 32 , 38 ). A total of 250,000 IU of streptokinase was administered into the pleural space for 3 to 7 days. However, the optimal dosage and required number of daily washings of streptokinase are still controversial. Furthermore, according to the negative results of MIST-1, streptokinase is giving way to other fibrinolytics such as urokinase, tPA, and DNase. Urokinase Urokinase is a thrombolytic agent derived from human neonatal kidney cells. Some case reports have shown that urokinase therapy improves pleural fluid drainage and reduces the need for further surgical intervention ( 33 , 42 ). In addition to these retrospective studies, some randomized clinical trials have shown that urokinase therapy increases pleural fluid drainage and reduces the referral rate for surgery ( 43 , 44 ). Tuncozgur et al. ( 45 ) also showed that intrapleural instillation of urokinase (100,000 IU/day) provided a better outcome and reduced the need for decortication ( Table 4 ). These randomized trials have increased the level of clinical evidence. Ozone The benefits of ozone therapy have been studied for more than a century. Ozone has been demonstrated to be a forceful and reliable antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses ( 31 ). Ozone induces the destruction of cytoplasmic membranes of bacteria and fungi by acting on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and other amino acids as well as by inhibiting key enzymes in the cells. Through these actions, microbial cell death occurs ( 31 ). Ozone can also be widely spread into the abscess cavity, resulting in abscess wall dehydration and expand the distribution of drug solutions ( 31 ). A retrospective study showed that combined treatment with ozone and urokinase is useful in the management of empyema and can safely reduce the rate of surgical referrals and the duration of hospital stay ( 46 ). The authors injected 50,000 U of urokinase diluted in 20 mL of normal saline into the pleural cavity through a pigtail catheter. In addition to urokinase, 10 to 20 mL of an oxygen-ozone gas mixture (ozone concentration of 25 mcg/mL) was administered through the catheter per day ( 46 ). A randomized prospective study is needed to assess the role of ozone in the treatment of this entity. DNase DNase synergizes with tPA or streptokinase in vitro and in animal models of empyema ( 47 ). MIST-2 ( 34 ) ( Table 4 ) demonstrated that the combination of intrapleural tPA (10 mg twice a day for 3 days) and DNase (5 mg twice a day for 3 days) resulted in statistically significant clinical improvement in pleural fluid drainage and a reduction in the length of hospital stay compared with the other three treatments (tPA, DNase, and placebo). Furthermore, a 75% reduction of surgical referral at 3 months was achieved in the tPA-DNase group compared with the placebo group ( 34 ). Six serious adverse events occurred in the study: two cases of intrapleural hemorrhage (both in the tPA-DNase group), one case of hemoptysis (in the placebo group), two episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (both in the DNase group), and one case of clinical deterioration (in the placebo group). The frequency of adverse events did not significantly differ among the groups ( 34 ). Thommi et al. ( 48 ) also showed the efficacy and safety of tPA for thoracic empyema in their double-blind randomized crossover trial. VATS VATS can be performed in patients whose chest tube drainage has failed or when the lung does not re-expand well after medical management. One retrospective study showed fewer complication and higher success with early treatment by VATS when compared with delayed surgery ( 39 ). In other studies, VATS debridement resulted in shorter hospital stays and superior empyema improvement rates when compared with chest tube drainage ( 49 , 50 ). Current guidelines advocate the use of surgery when an advanced fibrinopurulent phase is suspected by the presence of extensive pleural thickening that requires decortication ( 20 ). The need for surgery is usually assessed 5 to 7 days after initial treatment for empyema ( 51 , 52 ). Currently, VATS is considered as the primary treatment option for stage II empyema. However, the guidelines are based on low-quality evidence, and there are no reliable data to identify which patients are likely to benefit from surgical treatment or determine the optimal time point for referral to a surgeon. The recently proposed RAPID score enables clinicians to prognosticate at the time of presentation ( 53 ). VATS or open intervention remains the standard option for treating complicated pleural effusion or empyema. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines for the management of empyema recently classified VATS as a class IIa recommendation ( 24 ). According to this recommendation, VATS is considered to be the primary treatment in stage II (fibrinopurulent phase) patients (level of evidence B), and intrapleural fibrinolytics should not be used primarily for both complicated pleural effusion and early empyema (level of evidence B) ( 24 ). The European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery expert consensus statement for surgical management of pleural empyema demonstrated benefits of VATS decortication for stage II and III empyema, which are tolerable conditions for treatment with an operative procedure ( 54 ). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared VATS and chest drainage with fibrinolysis in the management of pediatric empyema ( 55 ). The authors evaluated previous randomized trials ( 7 , 35 - 37 , 40 ) and found that VATS and chest drainage with fibrinolysis for empyema in children have a similar incidence of perioperative complications and that VATS tends to reduce the need for re-intervention and is associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay ( 55 ). Open surgery Decortication For several decades, open decortication remained the only surgical treatment for complicated empyema ( 56 ). Open decortication has been adapted to remove fibrous tissue and peel from the parietal and visceral pleura in order to improve lung expansion, resulting in a greater lung vital capacity and improvement in symptoms. A recent analysis demonstrated equivalent effectiveness of VATS decortication in the management of advanced stage II or III empyema ( 57 ). However, the study showed no superior results with VATS versus open surgery decortication in the treatment of thoracic empyema. Therefore, VATS and open thoracotomy decortication can be recommended in the surgical management of thoracic empyema. However, in advanced empyema patients, VATS can be easily leaded to the conversion to an open surgery. According to these research findings, open decortication is saved for unresolved empyema. Open window thoracotomy (fenestration) Dr. Leo Eloesser, the surgeon who developed the surgical procedure associated with his name, reported in 1935 its use as an alternative to existing treatment for acute tuberculous empyema that were associated with high mortality ( 58 ). In his original report of the operation (Eloesser’s method), he constructed the window with a flap so that it functioned as a one-way valve, carrying out the fluid from pleural cavity while preventing air from entering the pleural cavity and causing lung collapse. This procedure requires partial resection of two to three ribs and creation of a U-shaped soft tissue flap that is folded into the chest cavity. Thourani et al. ( 59 ) subsequently proposed the modified Eloesser flap, which uses an inverted U-shaped muscle flap. Open window thoracotomy still remains a life-saving treatment option for patients with pleural cavity infection, especially in patients with bronchopleural fistulas (BPFs). This method requires resection of two to three ribs and careful separation of the chest wall muscles, which results in a segmental defect of the chest wall and a poor cosmetic appearance. Novel prosthetic devices for open thoracotomy, which require only a 3 cm resection in one rib, have been shown to be effective for resolving chronic empyema ( 60 , 61 ). These prostheses are self-retained silicone tubes, which drain out into a small plastic bag. Another novel device, the vacuum-assisted closure device (negative-pressure wound therapy), might help the management of patients with empyema by hastening recovery ( 62 , 63 ). However, the previous American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus guidelines warned that the vacuum-assisted closure method should be used with caution in the presence of a BPF or visceral pleural fistula ( 24 ). This open window thoracotomy technique has a specific advantage in the successful closure of BPF ( 64 , 65 ). In patients with a BPF, bronchial occlusion is necessary and an Endobronchial Watanabe Spigot (Novatech, Grasse, France) is sometimes used to decrease air leakage and thus avoid fenestration ( 66 ). Management of residual thoracic space Three approaches are used for treatment of the residual thoracic space. The first is a permanent open thoracotomy window. Second, the space can be closed and filled with antibiotic solution (Clagett procedure) ( 67 ) after achieving good control of the infection. The third approach requires plombage (pneumolysis) of the thoracic cavity with a pedicle muscle or omental flap with or without a partial thoracoplasty. The choice of biomaterials varies and depends on the surgeon’s preference, location of the residual thoracic space, and previous damage of muscles by prior surgery. The latissimus dorsi muscle, anterior serratus muscle, major pectoral muscle, greater omentum, or a combination of these organs are frequently used and can achieve successful results ( 68 ). Thoracomyoplasty is being increasingly used as a definitive approach to manage complicated empyema, especially in patients with a BPF ( 69 - 71 ). Recent topics and forward agenda Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Currently, the most reliable infection biomarkers are C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. In addition to these, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (STREM-1) is a promising biomarker in diagnosing pleural infection and deciding whether to use chest tube drainage ( 72 , 73 ). A large prospective study is urgently needed to evaluate this biomarker in the near future. The development of fibrinolytic agents is remarkable in the field of fibrinolytic therapy. In the coagulation cascade, a crucial factor of this reaction is the resolve of plasminogen into plasmin by tPA, which competes with inhibitory substances such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and -2 ( 74 ). The PAI-1 concentration is elevated within locules and is therefore likely to contribute to the formation of pleural septations ( 75 ). These facts have encouraged to target this specific pathway. PAI-1–targeting monoclonal antibodies can be used as adjunctive therapy ( 76 ). Lansley et al. ( 77 ) theorized that the injection of tPA itself induces pleural fluid production. Their experiment on mice revealed that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) involved in tPA-induced pleural effusion formation. They also found that MCP-1 antagonists could inhibit large effusion formation with intrapleural fibrinolysis ( 77 ). No prospective studies have yet been performed to evaluate fibrinolytic agents ( Table 4 ), although some prospective studies comparing various fibrinolytics or surgical intervention versus fibrinolytics are ongoing ( Table 5 ). These studies will contribute to the establishment of future guidelines.

Conclusions Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References The pathophysiology of thoracic empyema varies, and affected patients’ general conditions are poor. Therefore, physicians must evaluate the patients’ conditions and choose the treatment strategy early in the clinical course. Thoracic empyema is undoubtedly a complex issue of which some aspects have been clarified; however, many aspects are still under discussion, such as the methods of removing loculated effusions (various fibrinolytics versus VATS), the drainage techniques (open surgery versus VATS), the best timing of these treatments, and so on. For these reasons, thoracic empyema has thus not been treated on the basis of evidence from prospective studies as on the empirical basis. Multicenter controlled clinical trials are needed to resolve these problems, and widely accepted guidelines for the treatment of empyema must be established.

These patients often experience mental and physical problems because of restrictions in daily life and long-term treatment. Thoracic empyema is classified as acute or chronic empyema. The former is treated by antibiotics, thoracic drainage, fibrinolysis, or debridement under video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), while the latter is treated by managing the infection and reducing the dead space of the thoracic cavity. In this review, we summarize the procedures for various treatment methods and technical skills in the management of thoracic empyema. Chest physicians should consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method and choose an appropriate technique or possibly a combination of techniques to obtain an optimal outcome in the treatment of thoracic empyema. The techniques and knowledge described in this review will be useful for many physicians’ clinical work. Treatment methods differ among institutions, and a guideline for thoracic empyema is needed to standardize treatment of this entity in future.

This entity was first described in the fifth century B.C. by Hippocrates in his aphorisms, who proposed drainage as a treatment ( 5 ). For hundreds of years thereafter, empyema was treated using open drainage. However, most cases are now initially treated using antibiotics with or without repeated thoracentesis or tube drainage. Surgical approaches including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open thoracotomy are usually reserved for patients with a deteriorated clinical condition following failed conservative treatment. VATS has been shown to result in earlier and more complete resolution of empyema than tube drainage alone ( 6 , 7 ). Fibrinolysis has also been shown to be superior to tube drainage alone ( 8 - 10 ). The management of thoracic empyema is empirical, and its treatment strategy is controversial. Furthermore, limited data from controlled clinical trials are available to guide the management of thoracic empyema. This review highlights significant findings in empyema management to help readers comprehend the current status of this field. Epidemiology Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Recent epidemiologic studies have indicated that the incidence of empyema has been increasing during the last few decades ( 11 ). In 2016 in Japan, 2,833 cases of empyema were reported and hospital mortality rate was 6.9% ( 12 ). In the United Sates, the estimated incidence of parapneumonic empyema is 6 cases per 100,000 people, and the hospital mortality rate in the adult population is approximately 16.1% ( 13 ). Risk factors of empyema include diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux, poor dental hygiene, chronic lung disease, alcohol abuse, and so on. Empyema may develop as a complication of pulmonary infection, thoracic and abdominal surgery, trauma, and iatrogenic procedures. However, pleural infection may also occur as a primary infection without pneumonia. Pathophysiology and classification Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Acute empyema Thoracic empyema is the accumulation of purulent collections within the pleural cavity. Empyema is classified as acute or chronic and is also classified as localized or diffuse. Empyema is divided into three stages ( 14 ): stage I is an acute exudative phase in which the visceral pleura remains elastic and the dimensions of the thoracic cavity are maintained. Stage II is a subacute fibrinopurulent phase characterized by turbid, infected fluid with fibrin deposits constructing bridges that separate the effusions. Stage III is chronic organizing phase in which this construct is replaced by formal granulation tissue. Successful treatment of acute empyema requires immediate treatment with adequate antibiotics and tube drainage to prevent recurrence and chronicity. Most affected patients have small and uncomplicated effusion that can be treated conservatively with continued antibiotics, thoracentesis and observation. However, patients with loculated pleural effusion or purulent effusion on thoracentesis should be considered prompt insertion of a chest tube. Patients with loculated parapneumonic effusion (stage II, subacute phase), particularly those patients whose lung fails to re-expand, should be considered for early VATS procedure or intrapleural fibrinolytics ( 15 , 16 ). Chronic empyema Empyema lasting ≥4 weeks is classified as chronic empyema ( 17 ). At stage III empyema, the cloudy fluid begins to organize and form granulation tissue. The continuous inflammation of the infectious process involves in the formation of a fibrin peel on the visceral and parietal pleural surface. Continuation of this process also contributes contraction of the affected thorax in addition to a mediastinal shift toward the affected side and rib space narrowing. In general, chronic empyema is characterized by thickened visceral and parietal fibrin peels that hamper the ability of the affected lung to re-expand. At stage III empyema, chest tube drainage is no longer effective, therefore, chronic condition of pleural cavity needs surgical procedure. The purpose of surgical treatment is to remove purulent effusion, infected tissue and thickened pleura, and finally to close the empyema space to avoid recurrence. The selection of the initial treatment depends on the conditions of the patient’s pleural cavity and lung parenchyma. Classification by American Thoracic Society The American Thoracic Society proposed a classification system in 1962 based on the natural history of empyema ( Table 1 ) ( 14 ). In this classification, empyema is divided into three stages: exudative phase, fibrinopurulent phase and organized phase. The exudative phase lasts for several days and is characterized by a free-moving effusion in the pleural space. The fibrinopurulent phase is characterized by a reduced intrapleural fibrinolysis that causes fibrin deposition on the visceral and parietal pleura and is also characterized by a cloudy, viscous fluid. The organized phase is characterized by the fibrin and collagen deposition, resulting in fibrous thickening of the pleura. This classification is useful in practice and is still employed because the method of treatment is totally different in each stage or phase. Table 1 Three-stage classification by the American Thoracic Society Exudative phase (stage I) Fibrinopurulent phase (stage II) Organized phase (stage III) Characteristics of pleural effusion or pus Inflammatory processes extend to the pleura and result in immediate outpouring of fluid Frank pus accumulates especially laterally and dorsally Thick and sedimented exudate Pathophysiology of pleural effusion and pleura Low cell content High cell content and fibrin depositions over the pleural surfaces and fibrinous strands within the fluid Fibroblast growth and fibrosis Intrathoracic condition Re-expandable lung Tendency for development of loculations and formations of membranes Inelastic membranes over the pleural surfaces Beginning constriction of the lung Trapped lung Light’s classification According to Light ( 18 ), thoracic empyema is classified into seven categories as shown in Table 2 . This classification has four variables: fluid bacteriology, fluid property, fluid chemistry, and fluid pH. According to this classification, a typical parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the thickness of the pleural fluid is >10 mm, the pleural glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, the pleural fluid pH is >7.20, the pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration is <1,000 IU/L, and Gram stain and culture are negative. A borderline complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the pleural fluid pH is 7.00 to 7.20, the pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase concentration is >1,000 IU/L, the pleural fluid glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, and Gram stain and culture are negative. A simple complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the following criteria: the pleural fluid pH is <7.00, the pleural fluid glucose concentration is >40 mg/dL, and Gram stain is positive; however, the fluid is not loculated and does not appear to be frank pus. A complex complicated parapneumonic effusion meets the criteria for a simple complicated parapneumonic effusion with multiloculation of the pleural fluid. In a simple empyema, the pleural fluid is frank pus and the fluid is free-flowing without loculi. If the pleural fluid is frank pus and the fluid is multiloculated, these conditions are called to have complex empyema. This classification is widely accepted and is useful for physicians to choose the optimal treatment of thoracic empyema because each classification recommends a therapeutic option.

Guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians The American College of Chest Physicians proposed guidelines on the medical and surgical treatment of parapneumonic effusions in 2000 ( 19 ). This guideline has three variables: pleural space anatomy, pleural fluid bacteriology, and pleural fluid chemistry. These variables are used to categorize patients into four separate risk levels: category 1 (very low-risk), category 2 (low-risk), category 3 (moderate-risk), and category 4 (high-risk) ( Table 3 ). Table 3 Categorization of risk for poor outcome among patients with parapneumonic effusion and empyema by the American College of Chest Physicians Category Risk of poor outcome Pleural space anatomy Pleural fluid bacteriology Pleural fluid chemistry Drainage 1 Very low A0: Minimal, free-flowing effusion (<10 mm on lateral decubitus view) and Bx: Culture and Gram stain results unknown and Cx: pH unknown No 2 Low A1: Small to moderate free-flowing effusion (>10 mm and less than one-half hemithorax) and B0: Negative culture and Gram stain and C0: pH ≥7.20 No 3 Moderate A2: Large, free-flowing effusion (at least one-half hemithorax) loculated effusion, or effusion with thickened parietal pleura or B1: Positive culture and Gram stain or C1: pH <7.20 Yes 4 High – – B2: Pus – – Yes Diagnostic methods Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Imaging A staging assessment based mainly on the start of symptoms is not easily implemented in some cases. A chest roentgenogram, ultrasound examination, and chest computed tomography (CT) scan are all required and are considered as the primary imaging modalities for effusion ( 20 ). Imaging plays three important roles in empyema management: confirmation and characterization of effusions; decision for treatment, including thoracentesis, drainage, and surgical interventions; and follow-up of the patients after treatment. Chest roentgenogram Imaging techniques play a fundamental role in the management of empyema. In spite of advances in imaging modalities, the chest X-ray still plays a basic role in establishing the presence and amount of pleural effusion and guiding management during follow-up of patients. Asymmetric pleural effusion with blunting of the costophrenic angle can be recognized and smaller-volume effusions are detectable with a lateral-view roentgenogram. Chest CT Chest CT with intravenous contrast is optimal and has high diagnostic yield for empyema. Furthermore, a CT scan provides additional information about detailed anatomy including the mediastinum and hila. A CT scan is also necessary in some cases to confirm the characteristics of the effusion, determine the presence of pleural thickening or adhesions, and identify associated lesions such as tumors ( 21 ). Ultrasonography Ultrasound is an accessible, radiation-free method of visualizing free versus loculated pleural effusions. A previous study showed that ultrasound had better sensitivity for diagnosing pleural effusion than did plain radiographs ( 22 ). In the absence of clear loculation on ultrasonography, simple thoracentesis or chest tube drainage can be the standard treatment; however, patients with clear loculation require a form of thoracoscopy as an initial treatment ( 23 ). Thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis Diagnostic thoracentesis is crucial to demonstrate the presence of pus, which identifies the empyema. Additionally, pleural fluid sampling via thoracentesis is needed for fluid analysis and diagnosis of pleural effusion ( 20 ). For patients with a known pleural infection, intercostal drainage is required for appropriate treatment, and thoracentesis without pleural tube drainage is not recommended ( 24 ). Patients with empyema who have non-purulent pleural fluid with a low pH or glucose concentration can be managed with antibiotics alone ( 25 , 26 ). However, most patients who have purulent collections in their pleural cavity require VATS or open thoracotomy ( 27 ). Light ( 18 ) proposed a classification system that assists the physician in determining the aggressiveness of the initial therapy. We have described the details of this classification in the previous section of this review. Treatment modalities Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Antibiotics Although the choice of antibiotics should be essentially on the basis of culture in pleural effusion, antibiotic therapy is started empirically; in only a minority of cases is the antibiotic therapy adapted to the laboratory results because of the low rate of positive bacteriology results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for most patients with suspected or confirmed thoracic empyema. Antibiotics should be tailored to target pathogens based on epidemiology, antibiotic resistance patterns, cause of acquisition, and whether the affected patients are from a community versus healthcare setting. In community-acquired empyema, the antibiotic regimen should target common pathogens including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Appropriate antibiotics include a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination. In hospital-acquired empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be directed at providing coverage for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas . Reasonable options include vancomycin plus metronidazole and antipseudomonal cephalosporin. Intravenous administration of antibiotics is often appropriate initially; however, the administration route can be changed to oral when objective clinical (e.g., improvement in temperature) and biochemical improvement (e.g., C-reactive protein) has been observed. Continuation of antibiotic therapy is generally recommended for 2 to 6 weeks depending on the degree of aforementioned infection and clinical response to the treatment ( 28 ). Chest tube drainage A poor response to antibiotics is requires chest tube drainage. The optimal size of the chest tube and duration of tube drainage are not determined. A large multicenter study on the chest drain diameter in the treatment of plural infection showed no significant differences in any impairment in clinical outcome except insertion discomfort between small- and large-diameter drains ( 29 ). Clinically, the location of the chest tube is more relevant than the tube size, and inappropriate positioning of the chest tube can cause treatment failure. The appropriate removal time of the chest tube depends on two factors: radiological confirmation of successful pleural drainage and objective evidence of infection resolution. However, the presence of loculations frequently makes the effusion difficult to discharge from pleural cavity with chest tube drainage. In the situation, intrapleural fibrinolysis, VATS, or open surgery is needed. Fibrinolysis Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy was first reported in the late 1940s. Tillett and Sherry ( 30 ) used a partially purified streptococcal concentrate containing streptokinase and streptococcal deoxyribonuclease (DNase) intrapleurally in patients with fibrinopurulent pleura and empyema. To date, 11 randomized controlled trials have been performed since 2000, including both adults and children ( Table 4 ). Of these trials, the largest are Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trials 1 and 2 (MIST-1 and MIST-2) ( 31 , 41 ). MIST-1 showed that streptokinase at 250,000 IU twice daily for 3 days increased the amount of pleural fluid drainage, however, which was not associated with reduced mortality, lower surgical referral, or duration of hospital stay ( 41 ). MIST-2 was a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial for adult patients with pleural infection ( 34 ). This study showed that combined intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/DNase resulted in a significant reduction of pleural effusion in radiograph, a lower frequency of surgery, and decreased duration of hospital stay compared with placebo.

MIST, Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial. Streptokinase The most commonly used fibrinolytic in the clinical setting is streptokinase, and several prospective studies have proven the efficacy of this agent for thoracic empyema ( Table 4 ) ( 32 , 38 ). A total of 250,000 IU of streptokinase was administered into the pleural space for 3 to 7 days. However, the optimal dosage and required number of daily washings of streptokinase are still controversial. Furthermore, according to the negative results of MIST-1, streptokinase is giving way to other fibrinolytics such as urokinase, tPA, and DNase. Urokinase Urokinase is a thrombolytic agent derived from human neonatal kidney cells. Some case reports have shown that urokinase therapy improves pleural fluid drainage and reduces the need for further surgical intervention ( 33 , 42 ). In addition to these retrospective studies, some randomized clinical trials have shown that urokinase therapy increases pleural fluid drainage and reduces the referral rate for surgery ( 43 , 44 ). Tuncozgur et al. ( 45 ) also showed that intrapleural instillation of urokinase (100,000 IU/day) provided a better outcome and reduced the need for decortication ( Table 4 ). These randomized trials have increased the level of clinical evidence. Ozone The benefits of ozone therapy have been studied for more than a century. Ozone has been demonstrated to be a forceful and reliable antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi, and viruses ( 31 ). Ozone induces the destruction of cytoplasmic membranes of bacteria and fungi by acting on glycoproteins, glycolipids, and other amino acids as well as by inhibiting key enzymes in the cells. Through these actions, microbial cell death occurs ( 31 ). Ozone can also be widely spread into the abscess cavity, resulting in abscess wall dehydration and expand the distribution of drug solutions ( 31 ). A retrospective study showed that combined treatment with ozone and urokinase is useful in the management of empyema and can safely reduce the rate of surgical referrals and the duration of hospital stay ( 46 ). The authors injected 50,000 U of urokinase diluted in 20 mL of normal saline into the pleural cavity through a pigtail catheter. In addition to urokinase, 10 to 20 mL of an oxygen-ozone gas mixture (ozone concentration of 25 mcg/mL) was administered through the catheter per day ( 46 ). A randomized prospective study is needed to assess the role of ozone in the treatment of this entity. DNase DNase synergizes with tPA or streptokinase in vitro and in animal models of empyema ( 47 ). MIST-2 ( 34 ) ( Table 4 ) demonstrated that the combination of intrapleural tPA (10 mg twice a day for 3 days) and DNase (5 mg twice a day for 3 days) resulted in statistically significant clinical improvement in pleural fluid drainage and a reduction in the length of hospital stay compared with the other three treatments (tPA, DNase, and placebo). Furthermore, a 75% reduction of surgical referral at 3 months was achieved in the tPA-DNase group compared with the placebo group ( 34 ). Six serious adverse events occurred in the study: two cases of intrapleural hemorrhage (both in the tPA-DNase group), one case of hemoptysis (in the placebo group), two episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (both in the DNase group), and one case of clinical deterioration (in the placebo group). The frequency of adverse events did not significantly differ among the groups ( 34 ). Thommi et al. ( 48 ) also showed the efficacy and safety of tPA for thoracic empyema in their double-blind randomized crossover trial. VATS VATS can be performed in patients whose chest tube drainage has failed or when the lung does not re-expand well after medical management. One retrospective study showed fewer complication and higher success with early treatment by VATS when compared with delayed surgery ( 39 ). In other studies, VATS debridement resulted in shorter hospital stays and superior empyema improvement rates when compared with chest tube drainage ( 49 , 50 ). Current guidelines advocate the use of surgery when an advanced fibrinopurulent phase is suspected by the presence of extensive pleural thickening that requires decortication ( 20 ). The need for surgery is usually assessed 5 to 7 days after initial treatment for empyema ( 51 , 52 ). Currently, VATS is considered as the primary treatment option for stage II empyema. However, the guidelines are based on low-quality evidence, and there are no reliable data to identify which patients are likely to benefit from surgical treatment or determine the optimal time point for referral to a surgeon. The recently proposed RAPID score enables clinicians to prognosticate at the time of presentation ( 53 ). VATS or open intervention remains the standard option for treating complicated pleural effusion or empyema. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery consensus guidelines for the management of empyema recently classified VATS as a class IIa recommendation ( 24 ). According to this recommendation, VATS is considered to be the primary treatment in stage II (fibrinopurulent phase) patients (level of evidence B), and intrapleural fibrinolytics should not be used primarily for both complicated pleural effusion and early empyema (level of evidence B) ( 24 ). The European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery expert consensus statement for surgical management of pleural empyema demonstrated benefits of VATS decortication for stage II and III empyema, which are tolerable conditions for treatment with an operative procedure ( 54 ). A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared VATS and chest drainage with fibrinolysis in the management of pediatric empyema ( 55 ). The authors evaluated previous randomized trials ( 7 , 35 - 37 , 40 ) and found that VATS and chest drainage with fibrinolysis for empyema in children have a similar incidence of perioperative complications and that VATS tends to reduce the need for re-intervention and is associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay ( 55 ). Open surgery Decortication For several decades, open decortication remained the only surgical treatment for complicated empyema ( 56 ). Open decortication has been adapted to remove fibrous tissue and peel from the parietal and visceral pleura in order to improve lung expansion, resulting in a greater lung vital capacity and improvement in symptoms. A recent analysis demonstrated equivalent effectiveness of VATS decortication in the management of advanced stage II or III empyema ( 57 ). However, the study showed no superior results with VATS versus open surgery decortication in the treatment of thoracic empyema. Therefore, VATS and open thoracotomy decortication can be recommended in the surgical management of thoracic empyema. However, in advanced empyema patients, VATS can be easily leaded to the conversion to an open surgery. According to these research findings, open decortication is saved for unresolved empyema. Open window thoracotomy (fenestration) Dr. Leo Eloesser, the surgeon who developed the surgical procedure associated with his name, reported in 1935 its use as an alternative to existing treatment for acute tuberculous empyema that were associated with high mortality ( 58 ). In his original report of the operation (Eloesser’s method), he constructed the window with a flap so that it functioned as a one-way valve, carrying out the fluid from pleural cavity while preventing air from entering the pleural cavity and causing lung collapse. This procedure requires partial resection of two to three ribs and creation of a U-shaped soft tissue flap that is folded into the chest cavity. Thourani et al. ( 59 ) subsequently proposed the modified Eloesser flap, which uses an inverted U-shaped muscle flap. Open window thoracotomy still remains a life-saving treatment option for patients with pleural cavity infection, especially in patients with bronchopleural fistulas (BPFs). This method requires resection of two to three ribs and careful separation of the chest wall muscles, which results in a segmental defect of the chest wall and a poor cosmetic appearance. Novel prosthetic devices for open thoracotomy, which require only a 3 cm resection in one rib, have been shown to be effective for resolving chronic empyema ( 60 , 61 ). These prostheses are self-retained silicone tubes, which drain out into a small plastic bag. Another novel device, the vacuum-assisted closure device (negative-pressure wound therapy), might help the management of patients with empyema by hastening recovery ( 62 , 63 ). However, the previous American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus guidelines warned that the vacuum-assisted closure method should be used with caution in the presence of a BPF or visceral pleural fistula ( 24 ). This open window thoracotomy technique has a specific advantage in the successful closure of BPF ( 64 , 65 ). In patients with a BPF, bronchial occlusion is necessary and an Endobronchial Watanabe Spigot (Novatech, Grasse, France) is sometimes used to decrease air leakage and thus avoid fenestration ( 66 ). Management of residual thoracic space Three approaches are used for treatment of the residual thoracic space. The first is a permanent open thoracotomy window. Second, the space can be closed and filled with antibiotic solution (Clagett procedure) ( 67 ) after achieving good control of the infection. The third approach requires plombage (pneumolysis) of the thoracic cavity with a pedicle muscle or omental flap with or without a partial thoracoplasty. The choice of biomaterials varies and depends on the surgeon’s preference, location of the residual thoracic space, and previous damage of muscles by prior surgery. The latissimus dorsi muscle, anterior serratus muscle, major pectoral muscle, greater omentum, or a combination of these organs are frequently used and can achieve successful results ( 68 ). Thoracomyoplasty is being increasingly used as a definitive approach to manage complicated empyema, especially in patients with a BPF ( 69 - 71 ). Recent topics and forward agenda Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References Currently, the most reliable infection biomarkers are C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. In addition to these, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (STREM-1) is a promising biomarker in diagnosing pleural infection and deciding whether to use chest tube drainage ( 72 , 73 ). A large prospective study is urgently needed to evaluate this biomarker in the near future. The development of fibrinolytic agents is remarkable in the field of fibrinolytic therapy. In the coagulation cascade, a crucial factor of this reaction is the resolve of plasminogen into plasmin by tPA, which competes with inhibitory substances such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and -2 ( 74 ). The PAI-1 concentration is elevated within locules and is therefore likely to contribute to the formation of pleural septations ( 75 ). These facts have encouraged to target this specific pathway. PAI-1–targeting monoclonal antibodies can be used as adjunctive therapy ( 76 ). Lansley et al. ( 77 ) theorized that the injection of tPA itself induces pleural fluid production. Their experiment on mice revealed that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) involved in tPA-induced pleural effusion formation. They also found that MCP-1 antagonists could inhibit large effusion formation with intrapleural fibrinolysis ( 77 ). No prospective studies have yet been performed to evaluate fibrinolytic agents ( Table 4 ), although some prospective studies comparing various fibrinolytics or surgical intervention versus fibrinolytics are ongoing ( Table 5 ). These studies will contribute to the establishment of future guidelines.

Conclusions Other Section Introduction Epidemiology Pathophysiology and classification Diagnostic methods Treatment modalities Recent topics and forward agenda Conclusions Acknowledgments Footnote References The pathophysiology of thoracic empyema varies, and affected patients’ general conditions are poor. Therefore, physicians must evaluate the patients’ conditions and choose the treatment strategy early in the clinical course. Thoracic empyema is undoubtedly a complex issue of which some aspects have been clarified; however, many aspects are still under discussion, such as the methods of removing loculated effusions (various fibrinolytics versus VATS), the drainage techniques (open surgery versus VATS), the best timing of these treatments, and so on. For these reasons, thoracic empyema has thus not been treated on the basis of evidence from prospective studies as on the empirical basis. Multicenter controlled clinical trials are needed to resolve these problems, and widely accepted guidelines for the treatment of empyema must be established.

The\n Red-tailed Hawk or “Red-tail” as it is commonly called, represents the most\n common and widespread species of diurnal raptor in the Carolinas. In fact, it\n is the only common, permanent resident hawk species from every county of both\n states. However, more Buteo species occur in our region than any other group of diurnal raptor. And its\n members exhibit some of the most diverse plumage variation of any group of\nbirds in North America. The\n“good news” is that in the Carolinas, only two species, the Red-tailed Hawk and\nRed-shouldered Hawk, are common, permanent residents. A third, the Broad-winged\nHawk, breeds but is absent from mid-autumn through mid-spring. Two more\nspecies, Swainson's and Rough-legged Hawks are very rare but regular winter\nvisitors. Add to that, the specter of multiple subspecies variants, a handful\nof mega-rarities and incredible plumage variation among most of them, and we\nget to the “other news.” However, becoming “functionally proficient” in Buteo identification is greatly\nsimplified by acquiring proficiency with just three species, of which one is\nabsent half the year. Everything else is based on comparative familiarity with\nthose. Eastern Red-tailed Hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis borealis ) – Of the three commonly-occurring\nspecies, this is the largest and the principal species against which everything\nelse should be compared. Five variant populations of Red-tailed Hawk have been documented\nfrom the Carolinas, the taxonomy of which can be controversial. However, only\none (Eastern Red-tailed Hawk) is common and the second (Northern Red-tailed\nHawk) is so similar to the former that it poses little concern except for those\nwho wish to try their hand at subspecies identification. Figure 1. Red-tailed Hawk Figure 2. Red-tailed Hawk The\nRed-tailed Hawk is a chunky hawk with a rounded head, broad shoulders and a\nrelatively short tail (Figure 1). The beak is significantly larger than on any\nother eastern North American species (Figure 2). With rare exception, the head and\nback are dark brown, contrasting strongly with a tan to white under-parts that\nare divided mid-belly by a band of dark streaks and spots; the classic\n“belly-band” (Figure 1). However, it is important note that the prominence and\nextent of this belly-band mark is extremely variable, ranging from sparsely\nmarked light tan-brown streaks to a profusion of dark-brown streaks and spots\nthat may, on rare occasion, extend upward onto the chest. The\nback of a perched bird is nearly always accented by a patch of blotchy white along\nthe junction of the folded wings and shoulders due to large white scapular\nspots (Figure 3). No other Buteo known from our region exhibits this pattern. However, highly variable, it's not\nalways prominent in every Red-tail variant. Therefore, the presence of this\nfeature is a strong indicator, but its absence is no guarantee of something\ndifferent Figure 3. Red-tailed Hawk, showing red tail Figure 4. Red-tailed Hawk, showing red tail Figure 5. Immature Red-tailed Hawk Figure 6. Red-tailed Hawk, showing patagial bar Adults\nhave an orangey-red upper-tail from which their name is derived (Figures 3, 4).\nImmature birds resemble adults except\nthey have a brown tail that is marked by multiple narrow darker wavy bars\n(Figure 5). In direct comparison (or by extensive experience) the tail of an\nimmature bird is slightly longer than that of an adult. In\nflight, Red-tailed Hawks show both a dark, streaked belly band and a diagnostic\ndark patagial bar along the leading edge of the under-wing (Figure 6). As with\nthe rufous tail and prominent scapular spotting, this combination is diagnostic\nfor the species There\nare numerous subspecies and even recognizable populations of Red-tailed Hawk.\nBy and large, only two forms occur in the Carolinas with any regularity. The\nnominate form, known as the Eastern Red-tailed Hawk ( B. j. borealis ) is the default morph and is the one which breeds.\nThese birds are essentially residential and occur in all months. During winter,\nhowever, our local birds are supplemented by migrants consisting of two\npopulations: Eastern Red-tails and Northern Red-tailed Hawks ( B. j. abieticola )\nwhich breeds from northern New England and eastern Canada, west. Many\nauthorities do not recognize the Northern Red-tailed Hawk as a legitimate\nsubspecies separate from Eastern. However, those that do, point out that while\nEastern Red-tailed Hawks have no dark morph, Northern Red-tailed Hawks do. Figure 7. Northern Red-tailed Hawk Figure 8. Dark morph Red-tailed Hawk Figure 9. Dark morph Red-tailed Hawk Figure 10. Western Red-tailed Hawk Figure 11. Dark morph Western Red-tailed Hawk Figure 12. Red-tailed Hawk with minimal belly band Figure 13. Red-tailed Hawk with minimal belly band Light\nmorph Northern Red-tails are distinguishable from Easterns by virtue of much heavier, darker markings beneath and by the presence of a\ndark, contrasting hood (Figure 7). Dark phase birds are extremely rare in the\neast but in the mid-west are not uncommon, especially during migration. In\nevery way, they resemble traditional Red-tailed Hawks except their under-parts,\nincluding the under-wing linings are chocolate brown (Figure 8), appearing\nblack at any distance (Figure 9). Their dorsal surfaces are also a lot darker\nthan light morph birds but the solidly dark under-parts are all one need see to\nrecognize a dark morph. Within\nthe Carolinas, three additional forms of Red-tailed Hawk are documented.\nWestern Red-tailed Hawks ( B. j.\ncalurus ) closely resemble Eastern birds except they\ntend to be warmer-colored underneath, (Figure 10), up to and including a\ncinnamon dark morph (Figure 11). Adults are distinguished by having upper tails\nthat are marked by multiple brownish bands superimposed on the rufous base\n(Figure 10), visible from above and in good light, from below. However,\nthere is much variability in Red-tailed Hawk plumage, not only across different\npopulations, but also within a single population, including Eastern. For\nexample, some eastern Red-tails have minimal belly band markings (Figures 12,\n13). Except\nfor adult Ferruginous Hawk ( B.\nregalis ) (unrecorded from the Carolinas), no other\nNorth American Buteo has an\norangey-red upper tail. Thus, in the Carolinas, the presence of a bright rufous\nupper-tail should be regarded as definitive for Red-tailed Hawk and absent\ndetailed subspecific identification, presumed as default, to be Eastern\nRed-tailed Hawk. Figure 14. Red-tailed Hawk (Harlan's) Figure 15. Harlan's/Northern Red-tailed Hawk intergrade Figure 16. Red-tailed Hawk (Krider's) Figure 17. leucistic Red-tailed Hawk Figure 18. albinistic Red-tailed Hawk Two\nadditional forms of Red-tailed Hawk (“Harlan's Hawk” and “Krider's Red-tailed Hawk”) that occur rarely in our region have predominately white to\ngrayish-white tails that may or may not have some rufous coloration on their\ndorsal surface in adult plumage and brown banded tails in immature plumage.\nHarlan's Hawks range in color from coal black\n(Figure 14) to very white beneath. While the vast majority of Harlan's are\nblack, the incidence of light phase birds seems to increase farther east and\nthere is at least one record (personal observation) of a light morph Harlan's\nin North Carolina. Compared with Eastern Red-tails, light morph Harlan's\nclosely resemble nominate birds except their plumage tends to be colder,\ngray-brown, they have predominant white markings about the face and adults\n(usually) have a highly variable salt-and-pepper mostly white tail that is\nwhiter at the base. Some adult Harlan's can show a rufous washed upper tail but\nnever the solid brick-red of typical adult eastern. To further obfuscate the\nmatter, there are numerous intergrades of Harlan's and Northern Red-tails\n(Figure 15). Another\nmorph, the Krider's Red-tailed Hawk (Figure 16) is a\nvery pale version of Eastern red-tailed Hawk from the northern Great Plains.\nMost authorities do not regard Krider's as a\nlegitimate sub-species but it is so distinctive, it warrants discussion here.\nFundamentally, Krider's is a mostly white hawk with a\npale grayish-brown dorsum. As with Krider's, the\nupper-tail can vary from pure salt-and-pepper to washed with rufous.\nKrider's mostly or entirely lack a belly-band and have a\nminimal dark patagial under-wing bar. The head\nis also predominantly white. Calling\na mostly chalk-white Red-tailed Hawk type “Krider's”\nwould be easy were it not for leucism. Within all North American raptors,\nRed-tailed Hawks seem to exhibit leucism and partial albinism far more than any\nother species. Leucistic birds may appear pale and\nwashed out (Figure 17) or exhibit a piebald pattern of normal feathers set\nagainst pure white (albinistic) plumage (Figure 18);\nthese so-called “partial albinos). Note that only a pure white bird, complete\nwith pink soft-parts would qualify as a pure albino.\nDifferentiating a leucistic bird from a\nKrider's rests primarily in the fact that a\nKrider's has distinct dark plumage on the back and does so\nwith uniformity. Conversely, leucistic and piebald\nleucistic birds lack uniformly-pattered dark plumage,\nespecially on the upper-parts. Regardless of plumage, the one unifying\ncharacter of all forms of Red-tailed Hawk in flight is the wing shape. Without\nexception (molt aberrancies not-withstanding) the trailing edge of the wing is\nbroadly rounded from the body to the first of the notched primaries (“fingers”)\nof which there are five. In soaring flight, this combination results in a\ndistinctive shape to the wing that can be seen at almost any distance. The\nflight style of all variants of the species is predominantly soaring with\nminimal flapping – except when getting airborne or when the bird is in a hurry.\nWhen they do flap, it's often quicker and lighter than that of other large\nbirds (e.g., Turkey Vulture, Osprey, Bald Eagle) but is noticeably slower and\ndeeper than that of Red-shoulder. In addition, Red-tails\noften hang motionless in the air for extended periods of time as they scan the\nground for a potential meal. No other regularly-occurring Buteo from our region does this. Figure 19. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 20. juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 21. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 22. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Red-shouldered Hawk ( Buteo lineatus ) – With rare\nexception, any large Buteo in the Carolinas that's not a Red-tail is a\nRed-shouldered Hawk. By direct comparison, Red-shouldered Hawks are smaller and\nslimmer but without direct comparison, be careful about relying on size alone. Compared\nwith Red-tail, an adult Red-shoulder is bright orangey below and lacks a belly\nband (Figure 19). For almost any encounter with a perched Buteo, this dichotomy\nis task one in the identification process and it can't be simpler: White chest\nwith streaked brown belly band: Red-tail. Uniform orange under-parts:\nRed-shoulder. When perched facing away, the adult Red-shoulder's black tail\nwith narrow white tail bands is completely different from the brick red tail of\nan adult Red-tailed. In addition, and Red-shouldered Hawk lacks the row of\nwhite scapula spots that is evident on Red-tailed. Young\nRed-shouldered Hawks more closely resemble Red-tails than adult Red-shoulders.\nLike Red-tails, they have white or creamy white underparts and strong spotting\nbut the spotting is most dense in the upper chest and becomes progressively\nlighter moving downward (Figure 20). The tail banding, consisting of\nalternating thin wavy bands of dark brown and cream, while more defined than\nthat of a young Red-tail is not so different as to be a reliable field mark\nalone. Overhead, especially in strong light, young birds show a distinct pale\nbar-shaped region at the base of the primaries; the so-called “wing window”\n(Figure 20). When seen, this mark is distinctive for the species, but not\nseeing it does not automatically eliminate the species. Red-shoulders\nhave a proportionally smaller bill and longer heads and head which can be a\nuseful distinction. Moreover, Red-shoulders are frequently “tamer” that Red-tails,\nallowing much closer approach. Essentially, if the bird allows you to approach\nit on foot, it's probably a Red-shoulder. In flight, the combination of brick-red under-parts and bold black-and-white\nflight feathers and tail adult Red-shouldered Hawks is not only beautiful but also\nutterly distinctive (Figures 21, 22). Red-shoulders have a quicker and stiffer\nflap than that of a Red-tail, at times approaching that of a large Accipiter –\nwithout the classic Accipiter alternating “flap-flap-flap-glide” pattern. Very\nsuperficially, an adult Red-shouldered Hawk can resemble either an adult\nBroad-winged or adult Cooper's Hawk. In the case of Broad-winged, the\nunder-parts of Red-shouldered Hawk are orangey-red whereas Broad-winged is more\nrose-colored. Also, the reddish underpart coloration\nof Red-shoulder includes the under-wing coverts, whereas Broad-wings have essentially\nwhite under-wing linings. Figure 23. Broad-winged Hawk Figure 24. Cooper's Hawk Adult\nRed-shouldered Hawks have a predominantly coal black tail with multiple,\nsharply defined narrow white tail\nbands (Figures 21, 22). Conversely, Broad-winged has a wide white tail-band (Figure 23),\nespecially the trailing band, rosy\nrather than orange under-parts, tan to white under-wing linings and\nproportionally shorter wings. Finally, when seen from above, Red-shoulders have\ndistinctive red shoulder patches (Figure 22), thereby providing the source of\ntheir name. Confusion\nwith adult Cooper's Hawk (Figure 24) is also possible except the under-parts of\nCooper's are, like Broad-winged, rosy rather than orangey. Moreover, the shape\nof the two species is entirely different. Cooper's, being an Accipiter, has a\nvery long tail that has dark bands on a white background, vs white bands on\nblack (Red-shouldered) and Cooper's has proportionally much shorter wings with\na much less pronounced “hand” and an entirely different back by color and\npattern. Figure 25. Immature Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 26. Adult Red-shouldered Hawk In\noverhead flight, Red-shouldered Hawks are often touted as showing a distinctive\npale region at the base of the primaries that appears as a “wing window.” While\ncertainly true, this characteristic is more obvious in immature birds (Figure\n25), than adults (Figure 26). As\nwith Red-tail, the flight profile of Red-shouldered is a strong indicator of\nspecies regardless of plumage characters. The trailing edge of a Red-shouldered\nHawk's wing is less convex than Red-tail and when fully extended, is raked forward\nsuch that the leading plane of the outer-wing is noticeably ahead of where the\nwing joins the body (Figures 25, 26). The\nouter-wing of both Red-tailed and Red-shouldered Hawks possess five notched\nprimaries, a feature that is noticeably different other species that possess\nonly four notched primaries (e.g., Broad-winged and Swainson's Hawks) Two\nsubspecies of Red-shouldered hawk occur in our area. The nominate form or\n“northern” Red-shouldered Hawk ( B. l.\nlineatus ) (Figure 19) which breeds from northern South\nCarolina northward and “Southern” Red-shoulder ( B. l. alleni ) (Figure 26) from central\nflorida and Texas through southern South Carolina.\nDifferences are subtle, but adult birds are distinguishable in that northern\nbirds have dark brown vertical streaks on the breast and southern birds do not.\nDifferentiation of immature birds is not practical in the field and ultimately\ninconsequential. Note: a distinctive, pale, gray-headed form from southern\nFlorida ( B. l. extimus )\ndoes not occur in our region. Figure 27. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 28. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 29. Immature Broad-winged Hawk Figure 30. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 31. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 32. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 33. Immature Broad-winged Hawk with narrow tail bands Figure 34. Immature Broad-winged Hawk with adult-like tail bands Figure 35. Broad-winged Hawk with wing not fully extended Figure 36. Flock of Broad-winged Hawks Broad-winged Hawk ( Buteo platypterus ) – This is our only regularly-occurring small Buteo, being half the size (by\nweight) of a Red-tail and more than a third smaller than Red-shouldered.\nAlthough the species breeds throughout the Carolinas, its range is\npredominantly montane, becoming increasingly rare toward the coastal plain. A\nbit secretive, Broad-wings are seldom seen perched and following a massive\nsouthbound migration in early autumn, are essentially absent until mid-spring. An\nadult Broad-wing superficially resembles an adult Accipiter: barred reddish\nunderparts with a concentration of color on the upper chest (Figures 27, 28). However,\nthe tail of a Broad-wing is half the length of any Accipiter (Figure 24) and is\nmuch chunkier bodied. Young Broad-wings are streaked and spotted on the upper\nchest, becoming cleaner white below (Figure 29). As such, they resemble a young\nRed-shoulder but differ, plumage-wise, by being more blotchy including\n“cross-hatched” vertical streaks where-as the spotting of an immature\nRed-shouldered is separated and distinctive. In\nflight, adult Broad-wings have one or more bold central white tail-bands sandwiched\nbetween black bands that border it (Figure 30). Contrary to what is often\ntouted in field guides that emphasize, as a definitive field mark, the presence\nof a single white central tail band (e.g., Figure 30), adults may show two\n(Figure 31) or even three (Figure 32) white tail bands, both above and below. Thus\nwhile the presence of a single band is definitive for separating Broad-winged\nfrom Red-shouldered, the presence of multiple white tail bands is not. The\nunder-wing linings are cream-colored whereas adult Red-shoulders are brick-red.\nIn addition, the under-flight feathers of adult Broad-wings are mostly white\nwith thinner black bars and terminate with a wide black bar along the trailing\nedge of the wing. Young\nBroad-wings superficially resemble young Red-shoulders except Broad-wings lack\na distinctive wing window and have a very different overhead shape. The\ntail-banding of young birds is somewhat variable, but roughly assignable to one\nof two variations. 1) A series of multiple, narrow tail bands with a wider and\nbolder terminal band (Figure 33). 2) An adult-like pattern with wide black and\nwhite dark bands (Figure 34). However this adult-like pattern occurs only on\nthe inner tail-feathers. The outermost two or three feathers retain the pattern\nof multiple narrow bands (variation 1). Regardless\nof plumage, the flight profile of Broad-winged is radically different from\neither Red-tail or Red-shoulder. Proportionally shorter winged (Figures 30-34),\nBroad-winged Hawks have four notched Primaries (“fingers”) compared with five\nof its larger cousins. Moreover, the third outermost primary typically appears\nthe longest, giving the species a slightly stubby, pointed-wing shape,\nparticularly when the wing is not fully extended (Figure 35). The\nflight style of Broad-winged is light and buoyant. Soaring on a slight\ndihedral, they have a quick, almost Accipiter-like flap and make tight turns\noften markedly banked turns as they thermal soar. In migration, especially\nfall, Broad-winged Hawks are famous for moving in large flocks called kettles (Figure\n36). Most soaring hawks, kettle but Broad-wings are famous for it, sometimes\nmoving in massive flocks that number in the thousands or even tens of thousands. NOTE: The following species are rare to extremely rare in the Carolinas and great\ncaution should be exercised in their identification. In all cases,\nidentification necessarily must seek to eliminate all of the above-described\nthree. Figure 37. Rough-legged Hawk Figure 38.

Rough-legged Hawk from above Figure 47. Rough-legged Hawk from above Figure 48. Rough-legged Hawk Figure 49. gliding Rough-legged Hawk Figure 50. Red-tailed Hawk showing dihedral Rough-legged Hawk ( Buteo lagopus ) – This winter visitor from the far north probably occurs in our region every\nyear, but is far more likely in North than South Carolina. Beyond that, there\nis no strong pattern of occurrence with multiple sightings in some years to no\nsightings in others. A bird of the open country Rough-legs typically are not\nseen in areas in areas dominated by dense woods. Rough-legs\nare similar in size to Red-tails but with longer wings and are lighter weight.\nHowever, their bills are proportionally much smaller which, in combination with\na large head presents a very different head profile. In addition, in perched\nbirds the folded primaries are nearly as long as the tail and there is no white\nspotting on the scapulars (Figure 37). This combination of attributes offers a\nrelatively reliable way to identify this species when perched without having to\nrely on body plumage. Anyone fortunate enough to get very close can also look\nfor the Rough-leg's feathered tarsi (Figure 38) as opposed to the\nunfeathered of every other Buteo species presently recorded\nfrom the Carolinas. Relatively tame, perched Rough-legs are often approachable.\nHowever, anyone fortunate enough to get that close to a Rough-leg in the\nCarolinas will not likely need to see the feathered tarsi to make a definitive identification. Rough-leg\nplumages are incredibly complex, ranging from birds that are nearly pure white underneath\nto birds that are coal black, and varies by both age and sex as well as\nindividually. The typical field guides do a great disservice to their\nvariability by suggesting they come in just two color phases: “light” and\n“dark.” From\nan identification perspective, there is value in thinking about them, not as\nlight vs. dark, but as light, intermediate and dark although doing so might seem\nforeign to most observers familiar with traditional field guides. However,\nthere is more to this trichotomy than mere heuristics. Unlike any other Buteo,\nRough-legged hawks can be aged AND sexed by plumage characters although this is\nwhere a more refined understanding comes into play. On the one hand, in the\nCarolinas, the species is sufficiently rare that a full treatise on this is\nexcessive. However, from the perspective of identification (which is the\npurpose of this tutorial), being aware of the basic differences may be the\ndifference between a correct and an incorrect identification. For\nsimplicity purposes, the under-body plumage of a Rough-leg can be thought of as\ninvolving markings on the chest and belly that are either streaked or solidly\ncolored. Birds that combine lightly (Figure 39) or heavily streaked chest (Figure\n40) with streaked belly regions streaked would be more properly referred to as\n“Light Phase.” Birds with streaked\nchests and solid bellies (Figures 41, 42) are “Intermediate” or “Classic” and\nbirds with solid chests and bellies (Figures 43, 44, 45), “Dark.” In\nflight, light and intermediate as well as some darker birds (Figures 40-43) have\nwhite or cream-colored under-wing linings with streaks that may be sparse to\nheavy. However, they invariably show a broad oval blackish wrist patch that\ncontrasts against white primaries with black tips. In all plumages, the\nundersides of the flight feathers are bright white often contrasting to a dark\ntrailing edge. In dark phase birds the strongly pigmented underwing linings may\nobscure or completely mask the diagnostic black wrist patches but when visible,\nthe bold black wrist patch is a reliable mark for Rough-legged Hawk. From\nabove, most Rough-legs show a bold white basal tail (Figure 46) but dark birds\nmay lack this feature (Figure 47). Young\nbirds have a broad, uniformly dark tail band that occupies the distal half of\nthe tail (Figure 46) that has a diffuse margin with the basal white. Adult\nfemales have a more sharply-defined single tail band that may include a narrow\nterminal white band (Figure 48). Adult males have multiple dark tail bands, the\noutermost being wider than the remainder (Figures 40, 45). Interestingly, the\nlightest and blackest birds are usually adult males while intermediate birds\nare generally young and females. Young\nbirds also tend to have prominent white upper-wing patches at the base of the\nprimaries (Figure 46). With\nsuch extreme variation in Rough-legged plumage, gaining an understanding of the\nshape and flight style of the species is important to accurate identification.\nFortunately, the species presents a very different flight profile from other\nButeos common to our region. Compared with a Red-tailed Hawk (especially), Rough-leg\nhas longer and narrower wings. The leading and trailing edges are relatively\nstraight and roughly parallel and terminate with five notched primaries\n(“fingers” wherein the middle two are longer than those beside them, resulting\nin a narrow, even pointed-wing profile, especially when the wings are flexed.\nIn addition, Rough-legs commonly glide with their wings in a “W” positioned\nprofile (Figure 49), not unlike that of an Osprey, whereas Red-tailed commonly\nflies with a slight dihedral (Figure 50). Finally Rough-legs commonly hunt by hovering\non flapping wings whereas Red-tails will hang motionlessly. Figure 51. Swainson's Hawk Figure 52. Swainson's Hawk Figure 53. Swainson's Hawk Figure 54. Immature Swainson's Hawk Figure 55. Immature Swainson's Hawk Swainson's Hawk ( Buteo swainsoni ) – This predominantly western species occurs as a rare, yet somewhat predictable\nwinter visitor. Swainson's also come in multiple plumage variations, commonly referred\nto as “light” or “dark” although in this case, this dichotomy is a bit closer\nto the truth. Thus far, all birds reported from the Carolinas have been lighter\nmorphs. Light\nphase or “typical” adult birds are characterized by a grayish head, white\nthroat, broad brown chest and white belly. In particular, the dark chest and\nlight belly separation are sharply defined (Figure 51). Moreover, Swainson's\nhas dark flight feathers that contrast against paler underwing coverts (Figure 52). Both Red-tailed and\nRough-legged Hawks (with which Swainson's might reasonably be confused) have\nunder-wing linings that are darker than the flight feathers, In\nall cases, compared with Red-tailed Hawk, Swainson's are slimmer, have longer\nwings whose folded wingtips cross near the end of the tail and they have uniformly\ngray-brown backs that lack scapular spotting. In addition, Swainson's have four\nnotched primaries which compared with Red-tail's five, gives Swainson's a\ndistinctly narrow, pointed-wing shape (Figure 53). Young\nSwainson's Hawks show a variable combination of dark spots and streaks\nconcentrated around the chest which may or may not enclose a pale throat and\nupper chest (Figure 54) and under-wing linings paler than flight feathers\n(Figure 55). Regardless of the degree of coverage, these patterns are completely\nforeign to anyone familiar with immature plumages in Red-tailed or\nRed-shouldered Hawks. Figure 56. Ferruginous Hawk Figure 57. Ferruginous Hawk Figure 58. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Figure 59. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Figure 60. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Ferruginous Hawk ( Buteo regalis ) – Unrecorded in\nthe Carolinas, there are records from both southern Virginia and Florida\nmeaning this is a species which could occur. The world's largest Buteo,\nFerruginous Hawks resemble small eagles as much as they do a typical Buteo. In\nall plumages, they have a big flat head, noticeably wide beak (mouth gape) and\nat close range, feathered tarsi. Considering that seeing one in the Carolinas\nwould (at the time of writing) constitute a first state record, clearly seeing\nfeatures like this would be important proper documentation. Ferruginous Hawks\nalso come in light and dark phases, but the latter is rare even in the center\nof its range and won't be covered here. Adult\nplumage is distinctive, combining stark white underparts with rufous thighs –\nso called “leggings,” a predominantly rufous back and grayish head lighter than\nthe back (Figure 56). From above they have a rufous back and upper-wings with\nbold white wing patches that stretch from the outer primaries to the body. The\ntail is variably gray and white with some rufous mixed in (Figure 57). Young\nbirds are extremely white below, with variable spotting in the belly band\nregion but usually far less than any Red-tail (Figure 58, 59). From above they\nare warm brown with bold white upper wing patches and a Rough-leg-like brown\ntail with bold white basal band (Figure 60). The\nflight profile of a Ferruginous is distinct. Their wings are long and slender\nbut proportionally wider than that of a Rough-leg and have a distinctive white\npatch (visible from above) in the outer-wing. Except for some Rough-legs and\nCrested Caracara (no chance of confusing Ferruginous with that), no other Buteo\nhas bold white upper-wing patches. Ferruginous Hawks soar on a slight dihedral that\nis more reminiscent of Golden Eagle than anything else. When in power flight,\nthey have a slow, powerful flap. Figure 61. Adult male Snail Kite Figure 62. Immature or female Snail Kite Figure 63. Immature or female Snail Kite Figure 64. Immature or female Snail Kite Snail Kite ( Rastrhamus sociobilis ) – Though not a Buteo, this Florida\nEverglades species superficially resembles one and has occurred in both North\nand South Carolina. In all plumages, the very long, slender hooked beak (for a\nraptor) is unique (Figure 61). Adult\nmales are uniform charcoal grayish black. Seeing that and the bill requires no\nmore for identification (Figure 61). Immatures\nand females are brown with heavily streaked and spotted underparts (Figure 62),\na slightly notched brown tail (Figure 63) with a narrow white rump (Figure 64).\nThe plumage is sufficiently unique for identification by itself, but that\nunique bill is – or should be – the key to identification. In\nall plumages, the tail of a Snail Kite is white based with a dark (black = male\nor brown = female/immature) terminal half. Figure 65. Crested Caracara Crested Caracara ( Caracara cheriway ) – This bizarre relative of the\nfalcons, within the United States, is a non-migratory resident of central\nFlorida, Texas and along the US-Mexican border west through Arizona. It\nuniquely has a heavy bi-colored bill, red at the base and grayish-blue at the tip.\nThe head and chest are white with a sharply demarked black crown and dark\nhorizontal spotting on the chest. The mid-body area is solidly blackish-brown\nand the vent is white. There are large white patches in the outer-wing that are\nvisible from both above and below (Figure 65). Open country birds, Caracaras\nwould not be expected in wooded areas and are as likely to be seen on the\nground as perched on top of a pole or other elevated structure. Predominently Black Buteos With\nvery limited exception, other than vultures and eagles, no hawk in the\nCarolinas has a solid black body and under-wings. However, that is not to say\nthe possibility is nil and in the event someone does see a hawk with solid\nblack underparts, it's important to take note and pay close attention for two\nreasons: 1) it's rare and significant, and 2) identification is not going to be\neasy. Figure 66. Turkey Vulture Figure 67. Black Vulture Figure 68. immature Bald Eagle Before\ngetting into the dark-phase hawks, it's instructive to review the three common\nall-dark raptors that occur in the Carolinas: Turkey Vulture ( Cathartes aura ) (Figure 66), Black Vulture ( Corogyps atratus ) (Figure 67) and immature Bald Eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) (Figure 68).\nIn all cases, these species are as large or larger than Red-tailed Hawk and\nshould be familiar to anyone who regularly birds in the Carolinas. Except for\ndark Red-tailed and Rough-legged Hawks, all dark phase raptors that might occur\nare smaller. Red-tailed Hawk – Essentially any black-bodied\nRed-tail (Figures 8, 9) is likely to be a dark phase Northern Red-tail ( B. j. abieticola).\nMembers of this subspecies are regular wintering birds in the Carolinas and\ndark phase birds are seen with considerable regularity in the Mid-west. Solidly\ndark brown to black bodies and underwings mask the traditional dark belly band\nand patagial bars. Adults, with brick-red tails are easy but young birds can\npresent identification challenges. Focus on the bird's shape, especially the\nwing because no other dark phase Buteo will have the broad, rounded trailing\nwing edge of a Red-tail. Rough-legged Hawk – of all the candidates for a dark\nphase bird in the Carolinas, this is the most likely. Dark phase Rough-legs can\nbe brown or black (Figures 43-45) but in all cases will have a contrasting pure\nwhite panel in the outer primaries between the dark underwing coverts and the\ndark wing tips. Do not assume the bird will exhibit classic white tail base.\nDark Rough-legs commonly have all dark tails. Again, wing shape is critical in\naiding the identification. Compared with Red-tails, Rough-legs have long,\nslender wings and both have five notched primaries whereas Swainson's – which\ncan also be dark, have four. Swainson's also differs in having dark under\nflight feathers. However, to date, dark phase Swainson's Hawk is unrecorded from\nthe Carolinas. Snail Kite – Records of this species exist\nfor both North and South Carolina and include adult males. These birds differ\nfrom all others in the “dark phase” group in that they're uniformly slate gray,\nnot black including have dark gray flight feathers (Figure 61). Adult male\nSnail Kites are the only North American raptor that combines dark gray (not\nblack) plumage, bold white upper-tail band with bright orange legs and beak\nalthough younger birds, even though in otherwise adult plumage have a\nyellow-based bill (Figure 62). None of these characters are duplicated in any\nof the other dark phase contenders. Immature and female Snail Kites are brown with\ncoarse longitudinal streaks that run the length of the under-parts. The tail is\nbrown with a white base and is squared to slightly notched. Regardless of\nplumage characters, the, slender, deeply hooked bill is unique among raptors\nthat would ever (reasonably) occur in our region. Figure 69. Zone-tailed Hawk Zone-tailed Hawk ( Buteo albontatus ) – Shockingly, an individual of this tropical species was seen for nearly a week\nin September 2015 at the southernmost tip of the Delmarva Peninsula in\nVirginia, barely 50 miles from the North Carolina border. It had been seen up\nand down the east coast for at least two years and had in fact been seen\nmigrating past Cape May Point on two consecutive years. In 2014, after being\nseen at Cape May, it was seen crossing the water, then coming over the hawk\nwatch at Cape Henlopen, DE. In 2015, it was again seen at Cape May, then four\nhours later, over the hawk watch at Kiptopeke, VA. It\nwas seen repeatedly over the next few days until a tropical storm swept through\nand was never seen again. Zone-taileds are medium-sized, coal black hawks with a single\nwhite tail band (adult plumage) (Figure 69) or barred black and white in\nimmature plumage. In flight, they show contrastingly paler flight feathers\n(underneath) and soar with their wings in a distinct dihedral. As such, they\nare likened to Turkey Vultures (Figure 66) than other hawks. In comparison,\nZone-tails are smaller than the vultures, have proportionally larger heads that\nare black and feathered and they have the white and black banding on the tails.\nThe sighting of a solidly black-colored hawk in the Carolinas is not\nnecessarily a Zone-tailed. Red-tailed, Broad-winged, Rough-legged, Swainson's\nand Ferruginous Hawks all have black plumage morphs that could superficially\nresemble a Zone-tailed Hawk. Thus, a claim of Zone-tailed Hawk in our region\nnecessarily must first eliminate ALL other possibilities; not just Turkey\nVulture. Figure 70. dark morph Short-tailed Hawk Figure 71. dark morph Broad-winged Hawk Figure 72. light morph Short-tailed Hawk Short-tailed Hawk ( Buteo brachyurus ) – Unrecorded in the Carolinas,\nthis species has occurred in Georgia less than 30 miles from the South Carolina\nborder. Though that individual was a light-phase bird, some 80% of Short-tailed\nHawks in Florida are dark and the possibility remains that “lightning could\nstrike twice.” Compared with the other contenders mentioned, Short-tailed is\nsmall and proportionally short-winged (not actually so “short-tailed”). Dark\nphase birds are entirely black except for white under-flight and tail feathers,\nthe latter being thinly banded with a wider sub-terminal band (Figure 70). However,\na small black-bodied Buteo is not automatically Short-tailed. Although exceedingly\nrare especially in the east, there is an east coast record of dark phase\nBroad-winged Hawk (Figure 71) which would be very difficult to eliminate by\nplumage alone. However, the one reliable difference is in counting the number\nof notched primaries (“fingers”); Broad-winged has four, Short-tailed has five.\nWith adult birds, at least, the tail banding is also different. Dark\nShort-tailed has multiple fine dark tail bands and a wide terminal band.\nBroad-winged has a dark tail with a broad white central band (usually one). Light\nPhase Short-tailed is a much easier call. Birds have a pure white body and\nunderwings that contrast with a dark brown hood and darker flight feathers\nrespectively (Figure 72). The head is dark brown with a white throat and face,\nthus a dark “helmet.” Other than Swainson's, no other hawk that would likely occur\nin our area, combines darker flight feathers with white under-wing linings. By\ncomparison, Swainson's is much larger with a vastly different wing shape and\n(in most cases) a solid brown chest (not a helmet). FALCONRY Figure 73. Harris's Hawk The\nancient sport of falconry – the keeping and training of birds of prey for\nhunting – remains prevalent throughout the United States. While sentiments pro vs.\ncon about the sport can become emotional, neither position is assumed here. Regardless,\nit is true that on occasion, falconer's birds escape and sometimes those birds\nare regionally “exotic” species. It would be impractical, if not impossible to\ncover the breadth of possible escapes, but one species, by virtue of its\npopularity, merits brief consideration: Harris's\nHawk ( Parabuteo unicinctus ) .\nThis tropical species not only is a popular bird in falconry circles, it is a\nrelatively common resident of southern Texas and the southwest. Harris's\nHawks are predominantly dark gray with cinnamon upper-wing coverts, under-wings\nand thighs. They have white under-tail coverts and a white base to an otherwise\nlong, black tail with white tip (Figure 73). Young birds (which mature after\none year so not commonly seen as falconer's birds) are streaked below but\notherwise resemble adults with cinnamon upper-wings and rufous (barred)\nthighs. OTHER POSSIBILITIES If\nall this is not enough, a first-year Great Black Hawk ( Buteogallus urubitinga ) has occurred in the eastern United States. First sighted in April, 2018 at South\nPadre Island, Texas, it was relocated later that August in eastern Maine,\ncontinuing there through January 2019 (when it was found with frostbitten feet\nand had to be euthanized). This event highlights just how bizarre the\npossibilities may be. In addition, for many years starting in the early 1970's\nand possibly continuing through present, one or more Black Hawks of unsettled\nspecific identity (Common vs. Crab, vs. Great) have occurred in and around\nMiami, Florida (north to Greynold's Park, North Miami\nBeach). The origins of these birds are unclear and so far, none has been\nrecorded north of that narrow region of occurrence. SUMMARY Hawk-watching\nholds a special place in the world of birding and perhaps except for pelagic\nbirding, is unparalleled as a birding specialty. The entirety of North America,\nincluding the Carolinas, is peppered with organized hawk-watching stations,\nmostly to record the fall migration. With few exceptions, the stars of these\nstations are Buteos, predominantly Broad-winged Hawks in early fall (e.g., September)\nand Red-tailed Hawks later (October-November). Winter in the Carolinas,\npresents an excellent opportunity for hawk-watching, especially along the\ncoastal plain where large numbers of Red-tails congregate and are sometimes\naccompanied by rarities (usually Rough-legged and Swainson's although Harlan's\nand Krider's have been seen). This is what makes\ngaining proficiency at the identification of this group fun. Then, for those\nwho truly like to be challenged, invest time sorting through the myriad of Red-tailed\nHawks for different morphs (subspecies). They're out there for the patient\nstudent of the group. My only word in conclusion is to exercise caution when\nclaiming anything that is uncommon or rare. This group is incredibly variable\nand can cause confusion at any turn. Do not be ashamed of concluding that a\nparticular individual could not be identified. Even the most veteran\nhawk-watchers cannot identify every single bird they see.",

Other Resources ( NOT sponsored by Carolina Bird Club) Birding Links carolinabirds mailing list Facebook groups IDENTIFICATION PRIMER: THE BUTEOS Michael Tove For\n most people, the term “hawk” conjures up an image of a robust bird of prey,\n perched on a field-side tree limb, hunting for food, maybe including the\n farmer's chickens – the so-called “chicken hawk.” Within the Carolinas, this\n stereotypical hawk almost universally refers to the Red-tailed Hawk, a Buteo or “buzzard” hawk; the term\n “buzzard” referring not to vultures, but to old world hawks of the same group. The\n Red-tailed Hawk or “Red-tail” as it is commonly called, represents the most\n common and widespread species of diurnal raptor in the Carolinas. In fact, it\n is the only common, permanent resident hawk species from every county of both\n states. However, more Buteo species occur in our region than any other group of diurnal raptor. And its\n members exhibit some of the most diverse plumage variation of any group of\nbirds in North America. The\n“good news” is that in the Carolinas, only two species, the Red-tailed Hawk and\nRed-shouldered Hawk, are common, permanent residents. A third, the Broad-winged\nHawk, breeds but is absent from mid-autumn through mid-spring. Two more\nspecies, Swainson's and Rough-legged Hawks are very rare but regular winter\nvisitors. Add to that, the specter of multiple subspecies variants, a handful\nof mega-rarities and incredible plumage variation among most of them, and we\nget to the “other news.” However, becoming “functionally proficient” in Buteo identification is greatly\nsimplified by acquiring proficiency with just three species, of which one is\nabsent half the year. Everything else is based on comparative familiarity with\nthose. Eastern Red-tailed Hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis borealis ) – Of the three commonly-occurring\nspecies, this is the largest and the principal species against which everything\nelse should be compared. Five variant populations of Red-tailed Hawk have been documented\nfrom the Carolinas, the taxonomy of which can be controversial. However, only\none (Eastern Red-tailed Hawk) is common and the second (Northern Red-tailed\nHawk) is so similar to the former that it poses little concern except for those\nwho wish to try their hand at subspecies identification. Figure 1. Red-tailed Hawk Figure 2. Red-tailed Hawk The\nRed-tailed Hawk is a chunky hawk with a rounded head, broad shoulders and a\nrelatively short tail (Figure 1). The beak is significantly larger than on any\nother eastern North American species (Figure 2). With rare exception, the head and\nback are dark brown, contrasting strongly with a tan to white under-parts that\nare divided mid-belly by a band of dark streaks and spots; the classic\n“belly-band” (Figure 1). However, it is important note that the prominence and\nextent of this belly-band mark is extremely variable, ranging from sparsely\nmarked light tan-brown streaks to a profusion of dark-brown streaks and spots\nthat may, on rare occasion, extend upward onto the chest. The\nback of a perched bird is nearly always accented by a patch of blotchy white along\nthe junction of the folded wings and shoulders due to large white scapular\nspots (Figure 3). No other Buteo known from our region exhibits this pattern. However, highly variable, it's not\nalways prominent in every Red-tail variant. Therefore, the presence of this\nfeature is a strong indicator, but its absence is no guarantee of something\ndifferent Figure 3. Red-tailed Hawk, showing red tail Figure 4. Red-tailed Hawk, showing red tail Figure 5. Immature Red-tailed Hawk Figure 6. Red-tailed Hawk, showing patagial bar Adults\nhave an orangey-red upper-tail from which their name is derived (Figures 3, 4).\nImmature birds resemble adults except\nthey have a brown tail that is marked by multiple narrow darker wavy bars\n(Figure 5). In direct comparison (or by extensive experience) the tail of an\nimmature bird is slightly longer than that of an adult. In\nflight, Red-tailed Hawks show both a dark, streaked belly band and a diagnostic\ndark patagial bar along the leading edge of the under-wing (Figure 6). As with\nthe rufous tail and prominent scapular spotting, this combination is diagnostic\nfor the species There\nare numerous subspecies and even recognizable populations of Red-tailed Hawk.\nBy and large, only two forms occur in the Carolinas with any regularity. The\nnominate form, known as the Eastern Red-tailed Hawk ( B. j. borealis ) is the default morph and is the one which breeds.\nThese birds are essentially residential and occur in all months. During winter,\nhowever, our local birds are supplemented by migrants consisting of two\npopulations: Eastern Red-tails and Northern Red-tailed Hawks ( B. j. abieticola )\nwhich breeds from northern New England and eastern Canada, west. Many\nauthorities do not recognize the Northern Red-tailed Hawk as a legitimate\nsubspecies separate from Eastern. However, those that do, point out that while\nEastern Red-tailed Hawks have no dark morph, Northern Red-tailed Hawks do. Figure 7. Northern Red-tailed Hawk Figure 8. Dark morph Red-tailed Hawk Figure 9. Dark morph Red-tailed Hawk Figure 10. Western Red-tailed Hawk Figure 11. Dark morph Western Red-tailed Hawk Figure 12. Red-tailed Hawk with minimal belly band Figure 13. Red-tailed Hawk with minimal belly band Light\nmorph Northern Red-tails are distinguishable from Easterns by virtue of much heavier, darker markings beneath and by the presence of a\ndark, contrasting hood (Figure 7). Dark phase birds are extremely rare in the\neast but in the mid-west are not uncommon, especially during migration. In\nevery way, they resemble traditional Red-tailed Hawks except their under-parts,\nincluding the under-wing linings are chocolate brown (Figure 8), appearing\nblack at any distance (Figure 9). Their dorsal surfaces are also a lot darker\nthan light morph birds but the solidly dark under-parts are all one need see to\nrecognize a dark morph. Within\nthe Carolinas, three additional forms of Red-tailed Hawk are documented.\nWestern Red-tailed Hawks ( B. j.\ncalurus ) closely resemble Eastern birds except they\ntend to be warmer-colored underneath, (Figure 10), up to and including a\ncinnamon dark morph (Figure 11). Adults are distinguished by having upper tails\nthat are marked by multiple brownish bands superimposed on the rufous base\n(Figure 10), visible from above and in good light, from below. However,\nthere is much variability in Red-tailed Hawk plumage, not only across different\npopulations, but also within a single population, including Eastern. For\nexample, some eastern Red-tails have minimal belly band markings (Figures 12,\n13). Except\nfor adult Ferruginous Hawk ( B.\nregalis ) (unrecorded from the Carolinas), no other\nNorth American Buteo has an\norangey-red upper tail. Thus, in the Carolinas, the presence of a bright rufous\nupper-tail should be regarded as definitive for Red-tailed Hawk and absent\ndetailed subspecific identification, presumed as default, to be Eastern\nRed-tailed Hawk. Figure 14. Red-tailed Hawk (Harlan's) Figure 15. Harlan's/Northern Red-tailed Hawk intergrade Figure 16. Red-tailed Hawk (Krider's) Figure 17. leucistic Red-tailed Hawk Figure 18. albinistic Red-tailed Hawk Two\nadditional forms of Red-tailed Hawk (“Harlan's Hawk” and “Krider's Red-tailed Hawk”) that occur rarely in our region have predominately white to\ngrayish-white tails that may or may not have some rufous coloration on their\ndorsal surface in adult plumage and brown banded tails in immature plumage.\nHarlan's Hawks range in color from coal black\n(Figure 14) to very white beneath. While the vast majority of Harlan's are\nblack, the incidence of light phase birds seems to increase farther east and\nthere is at least one record (personal observation) of a light morph Harlan's\nin North Carolina. Compared with Eastern Red-tails, light morph Harlan's\nclosely resemble nominate birds except their plumage tends to be colder,\ngray-brown, they have predominant white markings about the face and adults\n(usually) have a highly variable salt-and-pepper mostly white tail that is\nwhiter at the base. Some adult Harlan's can show a rufous washed upper tail but\nnever the solid brick-red of typical adult eastern. To further obfuscate the\nmatter, there are numerous intergrades of Harlan's and Northern Red-tails\n(Figure 15). Another\nmorph, the Krider's Red-tailed Hawk (Figure 16) is a\nvery pale version of Eastern red-tailed Hawk from the northern Great Plains.\nMost authorities do not regard Krider's as a\nlegitimate sub-species but it is so distinctive, it warrants discussion here.\nFundamentally, Krider's is a mostly white hawk with a\npale grayish-brown dorsum. As with Krider's, the\nupper-tail can vary from pure salt-and-pepper to washed with rufous.\nKrider's mostly or entirely lack a belly-band and have a\nminimal dark patagial under-wing bar. The head\nis also predominantly white. Calling\na mostly chalk-white Red-tailed Hawk type “Krider's”\nwould be easy were it not for leucism. Within all North American raptors,\nRed-tailed Hawks seem to exhibit leucism and partial albinism far more than any\nother species. Leucistic birds may appear pale and\nwashed out (Figure 17) or exhibit a piebald pattern of normal feathers set\nagainst pure white (albinistic) plumage (Figure 18);\nthese so-called “partial albinos). Note that only a pure white bird, complete\nwith pink soft-parts would qualify as a pure albino.\nDifferentiating a leucistic bird from a\nKrider's rests primarily in the fact that a\nKrider's has distinct dark plumage on the back and does so\nwith uniformity. Conversely, leucistic and piebald\nleucistic birds lack uniformly-pattered dark plumage,\nespecially on the upper-parts. Regardless of plumage, the one unifying\ncharacter of all forms of Red-tailed Hawk in flight is the wing shape. Without\nexception (molt aberrancies not-withstanding) the trailing edge of the wing is\nbroadly rounded from the body to the first of the notched primaries (“fingers”)\nof which there are five. In soaring flight, this combination results in a\ndistinctive shape to the wing that can be seen at almost any distance. The\nflight style of all variants of the species is predominantly soaring with\nminimal flapping – except when getting airborne or when the bird is in a hurry.\nWhen they do flap, it's often quicker and lighter than that of other large\nbirds (e.g., Turkey Vulture, Osprey, Bald Eagle) but is noticeably slower and\ndeeper than that of Red-shoulder. In addition, Red-tails\noften hang motionless in the air for extended periods of time as they scan the\nground for a potential meal. No other regularly-occurring Buteo from our region does this. Figure 19. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 20. juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 21. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 22. adult Red-shouldered Hawk Red-shouldered Hawk ( Buteo lineatus ) – With rare\nexception, any large Buteo in the Carolinas that's not a Red-tail is a\nRed-shouldered Hawk. By direct comparison, Red-shouldered Hawks are smaller and\nslimmer but without direct comparison, be careful about relying on size alone. Compared\nwith Red-tail, an adult Red-shoulder is bright orangey below and lacks a belly\nband (Figure 19). For almost any encounter with a perched Buteo, this dichotomy\nis task one in the identification process and it can't be simpler: White chest\nwith streaked brown belly band: Red-tail. Uniform orange under-parts:\nRed-shoulder. When perched facing away, the adult Red-shoulder's black tail\nwith narrow white tail bands is completely different from the brick red tail of\nan adult Red-tailed. In addition, and Red-shouldered Hawk lacks the row of\nwhite scapula spots that is evident on Red-tailed. Young\nRed-shouldered Hawks more closely resemble Red-tails than adult Red-shoulders.\nLike Red-tails, they have white or creamy white underparts and strong spotting\nbut the spotting is most dense in the upper chest and becomes progressively\nlighter moving downward (Figure 20). The tail banding, consisting of\nalternating thin wavy bands of dark brown and cream, while more defined than\nthat of a young Red-tail is not so different as to be a reliable field mark\nalone. Overhead, especially in strong light, young birds show a distinct pale\nbar-shaped region at the base of the primaries; the so-called “wing window”\n(Figure 20). When seen, this mark is distinctive for the species, but not\nseeing it does not automatically eliminate the species. Red-shoulders\nhave a proportionally smaller bill and longer heads and head which can be a\nuseful distinction. Moreover, Red-shoulders are frequently “tamer” that Red-tails,\nallowing much closer approach. Essentially, if the bird allows you to approach\nit on foot, it's probably a Red-shoulder. In flight, the combination of brick-red under-parts and bold black-and-white\nflight feathers and tail adult Red-shouldered Hawks is not only beautiful but also\nutterly distinctive (Figures 21, 22). Red-shoulders have a quicker and stiffer\nflap than that of a Red-tail, at times approaching that of a large Accipiter –\nwithout the classic Accipiter alternating “flap-flap-flap-glide” pattern. Very\nsuperficially, an adult Red-shouldered Hawk can resemble either an adult\nBroad-winged or adult Cooper's Hawk. In the case of Broad-winged, the\nunder-parts of Red-shouldered Hawk are orangey-red whereas Broad-winged is more\nrose-colored. Also, the reddish underpart coloration\nof Red-shoulder includes the under-wing coverts, whereas Broad-wings have essentially\nwhite under-wing linings. Figure 23. Broad-winged Hawk Figure 24. Cooper's Hawk Adult\nRed-shouldered Hawks have a predominantly coal black tail with multiple,\nsharply defined narrow white tail\nbands (Figures 21, 22). Conversely, Broad-winged has a wide white tail-band (Figure 23),\nespecially the trailing band, rosy\nrather than orange under-parts, tan to white under-wing linings and\nproportionally shorter wings. Finally, when seen from above, Red-shoulders have\ndistinctive red shoulder patches (Figure 22), thereby providing the source of\ntheir name. Confusion\nwith adult Cooper's Hawk (Figure 24) is also possible except the under-parts of\nCooper's are, like Broad-winged, rosy rather than orangey. Moreover, the shape\nof the two species is entirely different. Cooper's, being an Accipiter, has a\nvery long tail that has dark bands on a white background, vs white bands on\nblack (Red-shouldered) and Cooper's has proportionally much shorter wings with\na much less pronounced “hand” and an entirely different back by color and\npattern. Figure 25. Immature Red-shouldered Hawk Figure 26. Adult Red-shouldered Hawk In\noverhead flight, Red-shouldered Hawks are often touted as showing a distinctive\npale region at the base of the primaries that appears as a “wing window.” While\ncertainly true, this characteristic is more obvious in immature birds (Figure\n25), than adults (Figure 26). As\nwith Red-tail, the flight profile of Red-shouldered is a strong indicator of\nspecies regardless of plumage characters. The trailing edge of a Red-shouldered\nHawk's wing is less convex than Red-tail and when fully extended, is raked forward\nsuch that the leading plane of the outer-wing is noticeably ahead of where the\nwing joins the body (Figures 25, 26). The\nouter-wing of both Red-tailed and Red-shouldered Hawks possess five notched\nprimaries, a feature that is noticeably different other species that possess\nonly four notched primaries (e.g., Broad-winged and Swainson's Hawks) Two\nsubspecies of Red-shouldered hawk occur in our area. The nominate form or\n“northern” Red-shouldered Hawk ( B. l.\nlineatus ) (Figure 19) which breeds from northern South\nCarolina northward and “Southern” Red-shoulder ( B. l. alleni ) (Figure 26) from central\nflorida and Texas through southern South Carolina.\nDifferences are subtle, but adult birds are distinguishable in that northern\nbirds have dark brown vertical streaks on the breast and southern birds do not.\nDifferentiation of immature birds is not practical in the field and ultimately\ninconsequential. Note: a distinctive, pale, gray-headed form from southern\nFlorida ( B. l. extimus )\ndoes not occur in our region. Figure 27. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 28. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 29. Immature Broad-winged Hawk Figure 30. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 31. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 32. Adult Broad-winged Hawk Figure 33. Immature Broad-winged Hawk with narrow tail bands Figure 34. Immature Broad-winged Hawk with adult-like tail bands Figure 35. Broad-winged Hawk with wing not fully extended Figure 36. Flock of Broad-winged Hawks Broad-winged Hawk ( Buteo platypterus ) – This is our only regularly-occurring small Buteo, being half the size (by\nweight) of a Red-tail and more than a third smaller than Red-shouldered.\nAlthough the species breeds throughout the Carolinas, its range is\npredominantly montane, becoming increasingly rare toward the coastal plain. A\nbit secretive, Broad-wings are seldom seen perched and following a massive\nsouthbound migration in early autumn, are essentially absent until mid-spring. An\nadult Broad-wing superficially resembles an adult Accipiter: barred reddish\nunderparts with a concentration of color on the upper chest (Figures 27, 28). However,\nthe tail of a Broad-wing is half the length of any Accipiter (Figure 24) and is\nmuch chunkier bodied. Young Broad-wings are streaked and spotted on the upper\nchest, becoming cleaner white below (Figure 29). As such, they resemble a young\nRed-shoulder but differ, plumage-wise, by being more blotchy including\n“cross-hatched” vertical streaks where-as the spotting of an immature\nRed-shouldered is separated and distinctive. In\nflight, adult Broad-wings have one or more bold central white tail-bands sandwiched\nbetween black bands that border it (Figure 30). Contrary to what is often\ntouted in field guides that emphasize, as a definitive field mark, the presence\nof a single white central tail band (e.g., Figure 30), adults may show two\n(Figure 31) or even three (Figure 32) white tail bands, both above and below. Thus\nwhile the presence of a single band is definitive for separating Broad-winged\nfrom Red-shouldered, the presence of multiple white tail bands is not. The\nunder-wing linings are cream-colored whereas adult Red-shoulders are brick-red.\nIn addition, the under-flight feathers of adult Broad-wings are mostly white\nwith thinner black bars and terminate with a wide black bar along the trailing\nedge of the wing. Young\nBroad-wings superficially resemble young Red-shoulders except Broad-wings lack\na distinctive wing window and have a very different overhead shape. The\ntail-banding of young birds is somewhat variable, but roughly assignable to one\nof two variations. 1) A series of multiple, narrow tail bands with a wider and\nbolder terminal band (Figure 33). 2) An adult-like pattern with wide black and\nwhite dark bands (Figure 34). However this adult-like pattern occurs only on\nthe inner tail-feathers. The outermost two or three feathers retain the pattern\nof multiple narrow bands (variation 1). Regardless\nof plumage, the flight profile of Broad-winged is radically different from\neither Red-tail or Red-shoulder. Proportionally shorter winged (Figures 30-34),\nBroad-winged Hawks have four notched Primaries (“fingers”) compared with five\nof its larger cousins. Moreover, the third outermost primary typically appears\nthe longest, giving the species a slightly stubby, pointed-wing shape,\nparticularly when the wing is not fully extended (Figure 35). The\nflight style of Broad-winged is light and buoyant. Soaring on a slight\ndihedral, they have a quick, almost Accipiter-like flap and make tight turns\noften markedly banked turns as they thermal soar. In migration, especially\nfall, Broad-winged Hawks are famous for moving in large flocks called kettles (Figure\n36). Most soaring hawks, kettle but Broad-wings are famous for it, sometimes\nmoving in massive flocks that number in the thousands or even tens of thousands. NOTE: The following species are rare to extremely rare in the Carolinas and great\ncaution should be exercised in their identification. In all cases,\nidentification necessarily must seek to eliminate all of the above-described\nthree. Figure 37. Rough-legged Hawk Figure 38.

Red-tailed Hawk showing dihedral Rough-legged Hawk ( Buteo lagopus ) – This winter visitor from the far north probably occurs in our region every\nyear, but is far more likely in North than South Carolina. Beyond that, there\nis no strong pattern of occurrence with multiple sightings in some years to no\nsightings in others. A bird of the open country Rough-legs typically are not\nseen in areas in areas dominated by dense woods. Rough-legs\nare similar in size to Red-tails but with longer wings and are lighter weight.\nHowever, their bills are proportionally much smaller which, in combination with\na large head presents a very different head profile. In addition, in perched\nbirds the folded primaries are nearly as long as the tail and there is no white\nspotting on the scapulars (Figure 37). This combination of attributes offers a\nrelatively reliable way to identify this species when perched without having to\nrely on body plumage. Anyone fortunate enough to get very close can also look\nfor the Rough-leg's feathered tarsi (Figure 38) as opposed to the\nunfeathered of every other Buteo species presently recorded\nfrom the Carolinas. Relatively tame, perched Rough-legs are often approachable.\nHowever, anyone fortunate enough to get that close to a Rough-leg in the\nCarolinas will not likely need to see the feathered tarsi to make a definitive identification. Rough-leg\nplumages are incredibly complex, ranging from birds that are nearly pure white underneath\nto birds that are coal black, and varies by both age and sex as well as\nindividually. The typical field guides do a great disservice to their\nvariability by suggesting they come in just two color phases: “light” and\n“dark.” From\nan identification perspective, there is value in thinking about them, not as\nlight vs. dark, but as light, intermediate and dark although doing so might seem\nforeign to most observers familiar with traditional field guides. However,\nthere is more to this trichotomy than mere heuristics. Unlike any other Buteo,\nRough-legged hawks can be aged AND sexed by plumage characters although this is\nwhere a more refined understanding comes into play. On the one hand, in the\nCarolinas, the species is sufficiently rare that a full treatise on this is\nexcessive. However, from the perspective of identification (which is the\npurpose of this tutorial), being aware of the basic differences may be the\ndifference between a correct and an incorrect identification. For\nsimplicity purposes, the under-body plumage of a Rough-leg can be thought of as\ninvolving markings on the chest and belly that are either streaked or solidly\ncolored. Birds that combine lightly (Figure 39) or heavily streaked chest (Figure\n40) with streaked belly regions streaked would be more properly referred to as\n“Light Phase.” Birds with streaked\nchests and solid bellies (Figures 41, 42) are “Intermediate” or “Classic” and\nbirds with solid chests and bellies (Figures 43, 44, 45), “Dark.” In\nflight, light and intermediate as well as some darker birds (Figures 40-43) have\nwhite or cream-colored under-wing linings with streaks that may be sparse to\nheavy. However, they invariably show a broad oval blackish wrist patch that\ncontrasts against white primaries with black tips. In all plumages, the\nundersides of the flight feathers are bright white often contrasting to a dark\ntrailing edge. In dark phase birds the strongly pigmented underwing linings may\nobscure or completely mask the diagnostic black wrist patches but when visible,\nthe bold black wrist patch is a reliable mark for Rough-legged Hawk. From\nabove, most Rough-legs show a bold white basal tail (Figure 46) but dark birds\nmay lack this feature (Figure 47). Young\nbirds have a broad, uniformly dark tail band that occupies the distal half of\nthe tail (Figure 46) that has a diffuse margin with the basal white. Adult\nfemales have a more sharply-defined single tail band that may include a narrow\nterminal white band (Figure 48). Adult males have multiple dark tail bands, the\noutermost being wider than the remainder (Figures 40, 45). Interestingly, the\nlightest and blackest birds are usually adult males while intermediate birds\nare generally young and females. Young\nbirds also tend to have prominent white upper-wing patches at the base of the\nprimaries (Figure 46). With\nsuch extreme variation in Rough-legged plumage, gaining an understanding of the\nshape and flight style of the species is important to accurate identification.\nFortunately, the species presents a very different flight profile from other\nButeos common to our region. Compared with a Red-tailed Hawk (especially), Rough-leg\nhas longer and narrower wings. The leading and trailing edges are relatively\nstraight and roughly parallel and terminate with five notched primaries\n(“fingers” wherein the middle two are longer than those beside them, resulting\nin a narrow, even pointed-wing profile, especially when the wings are flexed.\nIn addition, Rough-legs commonly glide with their wings in a “W” positioned\nprofile (Figure 49), not unlike that of an Osprey, whereas Red-tailed commonly\nflies with a slight dihedral (Figure 50). Finally Rough-legs commonly hunt by hovering\non flapping wings whereas Red-tails will hang motionlessly. Figure 51. Swainson's Hawk Figure 52. Swainson's Hawk Figure 53. Swainson's Hawk Figure 54. Immature Swainson's Hawk Figure 55. Immature Swainson's Hawk Swainson's Hawk ( Buteo swainsoni ) – This predominantly western species occurs as a rare, yet somewhat predictable\nwinter visitor. Swainson's also come in multiple plumage variations, commonly referred\nto as “light” or “dark” although in this case, this dichotomy is a bit closer\nto the truth. Thus far, all birds reported from the Carolinas have been lighter\nmorphs. Light\nphase or “typical” adult birds are characterized by a grayish head, white\nthroat, broad brown chest and white belly. In particular, the dark chest and\nlight belly separation are sharply defined (Figure 51). Moreover, Swainson's\nhas dark flight feathers that contrast against paler underwing coverts (Figure 52). Both Red-tailed and\nRough-legged Hawks (with which Swainson's might reasonably be confused) have\nunder-wing linings that are darker than the flight feathers, In\nall cases, compared with Red-tailed Hawk, Swainson's are slimmer, have longer\nwings whose folded wingtips cross near the end of the tail and they have uniformly\ngray-brown backs that lack scapular spotting. In addition, Swainson's have four\nnotched primaries which compared with Red-tail's five, gives Swainson's a\ndistinctly narrow, pointed-wing shape (Figure 53). Young\nSwainson's Hawks show a variable combination of dark spots and streaks\nconcentrated around the chest which may or may not enclose a pale throat and\nupper chest (Figure 54) and under-wing linings paler than flight feathers\n(Figure 55). Regardless of the degree of coverage, these patterns are completely\nforeign to anyone familiar with immature plumages in Red-tailed or\nRed-shouldered Hawks. Figure 56. Ferruginous Hawk Figure 57. Ferruginous Hawk Figure 58. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Figure 59. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Figure 60. Immature Ferruginous Hawk Ferruginous Hawk ( Buteo regalis ) – Unrecorded in\nthe Carolinas, there are records from both southern Virginia and Florida\nmeaning this is a species which could occur. The world's largest Buteo,\nFerruginous Hawks resemble small eagles as much as they do a typical Buteo. In\nall plumages, they have a big flat head, noticeably wide beak (mouth gape) and\nat close range, feathered tarsi. Considering that seeing one in the Carolinas\nwould (at the time of writing) constitute a first state record, clearly seeing\nfeatures like this would be important proper documentation. Ferruginous Hawks\nalso come in light and dark phases, but the latter is rare even in the center\nof its range and won't be covered here. Adult\nplumage is distinctive, combining stark white underparts with rufous thighs –\nso called “leggings,” a predominantly rufous back and grayish head lighter than\nthe back (Figure 56). From above they have a rufous back and upper-wings with\nbold white wing patches that stretch from the outer primaries to the body. The\ntail is variably gray and white with some rufous mixed in (Figure 57). Young\nbirds are extremely white below, with variable spotting in the belly band\nregion but usually far less than any Red-tail (Figure 58, 59). From above they\nare warm brown with bold white upper wing patches and a Rough-leg-like brown\ntail with bold white basal band (Figure 60). The\nflight profile of a Ferruginous is distinct. Their wings are long and slender\nbut proportionally wider than that of a Rough-leg and have a distinctive white\npatch (visible from above) in the outer-wing. Except for some Rough-legs and\nCrested Caracara (no chance of confusing Ferruginous with that), no other Buteo\nhas bold white upper-wing patches. Ferruginous Hawks soar on a slight dihedral that\nis more reminiscent of Golden Eagle than anything else. When in power flight,\nthey have a slow, powerful flap. Figure 61. Adult male Snail Kite Figure 62. Immature or female Snail Kite Figure 63. Immature or female Snail Kite Figure 64. Immature or female Snail Kite Snail Kite ( Rastrhamus sociobilis ) – Though not a Buteo, this Florida\nEverglades species superficially resembles one and has occurred in both North\nand South Carolina. In all plumages, the very long, slender hooked beak (for a\nraptor) is unique (Figure 61). Adult\nmales are uniform charcoal grayish black. Seeing that and the bill requires no\nmore for identification (Figure 61). Immatures\nand females are brown with heavily streaked and spotted underparts (Figure 62),\na slightly notched brown tail (Figure 63) with a narrow white rump (Figure 64).\nThe plumage is sufficiently unique for identification by itself, but that\nunique bill is – or should be – the key to identification. In\nall plumages, the tail of a Snail Kite is white based with a dark (black = male\nor brown = female/immature) terminal half. Figure 65. Crested Caracara Crested Caracara ( Caracara cheriway ) – This bizarre relative of the\nfalcons, within the United States, is a non-migratory resident of central\nFlorida, Texas and along the US-Mexican border west through Arizona. It\nuniquely has a heavy bi-colored bill, red at the base and grayish-blue at the tip.\nThe head and chest are white with a sharply demarked black crown and dark\nhorizontal spotting on the chest. The mid-body area is solidly blackish-brown\nand the vent is white. There are large white patches in the outer-wing that are\nvisible from both above and below (Figure 65). Open country birds, Caracaras\nwould not be expected in wooded areas and are as likely to be seen on the\nground as perched on top of a pole or other elevated structure. Predominently Black Buteos With\nvery limited exception, other than vultures and eagles, no hawk in the\nCarolinas has a solid black body and under-wings. However, that is not to say\nthe possibility is nil and in the event someone does see a hawk with solid\nblack underparts, it's important to take note and pay close attention for two\nreasons: 1) it's rare and significant, and 2) identification is not going to be\neasy. Figure 66. Turkey Vulture Figure 67. Black Vulture Figure 68. immature Bald Eagle Before\ngetting into the dark-phase hawks, it's instructive to review the three common\nall-dark raptors that occur in the Carolinas: Turkey Vulture ( Cathartes aura ) (Figure 66), Black Vulture ( Corogyps atratus ) (Figure 67) and immature Bald Eagle ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) (Figure 68).\nIn all cases, these species are as large or larger than Red-tailed Hawk and\nshould be familiar to anyone who regularly birds in the Carolinas. Except for\ndark Red-tailed and Rough-legged Hawks, all dark phase raptors that might occur\nare smaller. Red-tailed Hawk – Essentially any black-bodied\nRed-tail (Figures 8, 9) is likely to be a dark phase Northern Red-tail ( B. j. abieticola).\nMembers of this subspecies are regular wintering birds in the Carolinas and\ndark phase birds are seen with considerable regularity in the Mid-west. Solidly\ndark brown to black bodies and underwings mask the traditional dark belly band\nand patagial bars. Adults, with brick-red tails are easy but young birds can\npresent identification challenges. Focus on the bird's shape, especially the\nwing because no other dark phase Buteo will have the broad, rounded trailing\nwing edge of a Red-tail. Rough-legged Hawk – of all the candidates for a dark\nphase bird in the Carolinas, this is the most likely. Dark phase Rough-legs can\nbe brown or black (Figures 43-45) but in all cases will have a contrasting pure\nwhite panel in the outer primaries between the dark underwing coverts and the\ndark wing tips. Do not assume the bird will exhibit classic white tail base.\nDark Rough-legs commonly have all dark tails. Again, wing shape is critical in\naiding the identification. Compared with Red-tails, Rough-legs have long,\nslender wings and both have five notched primaries whereas Swainson's – which\ncan also be dark, have four. Swainson's also differs in having dark under\nflight feathers. However, to date, dark phase Swainson's Hawk is unrecorded from\nthe Carolinas. Snail Kite – Records of this species exist\nfor both North and South Carolina and include adult males. These birds differ\nfrom all others in the “dark phase” group in that they're uniformly slate gray,\nnot black including have dark gray flight feathers (Figure 61). Adult male\nSnail Kites are the only North American raptor that combines dark gray (not\nblack) plumage, bold white upper-tail band with bright orange legs and beak\nalthough younger birds, even though in otherwise adult plumage have a\nyellow-based bill (Figure 62). None of these characters are duplicated in any\nof the other dark phase contenders. Immature and female Snail Kites are brown with\ncoarse longitudinal streaks that run the length of the under-parts. The tail is\nbrown with a white base and is squared to slightly notched. Regardless of\nplumage characters, the, slender, deeply hooked bill is unique among raptors\nthat would ever (reasonably) occur in our region. Figure 69. Zone-tailed Hawk Zone-tailed Hawk ( Buteo albontatus ) – Shockingly, an individual of this tropical species was seen for nearly a week\nin September 2015 at the southernmost tip of the Delmarva Peninsula in\nVirginia, barely 50 miles from the North Carolina border. It had been seen up\nand down the east coast for at least two years and had in fact been seen\nmigrating past Cape May Point on two consecutive years. In 2014, after being\nseen at Cape May, it was seen crossing the water, then coming over the hawk\nwatch at Cape Henlopen, DE. In 2015, it was again seen at Cape May, then four\nhours later, over the hawk watch at Kiptopeke, VA. It\nwas seen repeatedly over the next few days until a tropical storm swept through\nand was never seen again. Zone-taileds are medium-sized, coal black hawks with a single\nwhite tail band (adult plumage) (Figure 69) or barred black and white in\nimmature plumage. In flight, they show contrastingly paler flight feathers\n(underneath) and soar with their wings in a distinct dihedral. As such, they\nare likened to Turkey Vultures (Figure 66) than other hawks. In comparison,\nZone-tails are smaller than the vultures, have proportionally larger heads that\nare black and feathered and they have the white and black banding on the tails.\nThe sighting of a solidly black-colored hawk in the Carolinas is not\nnecessarily a Zone-tailed. Red-tailed, Broad-winged, Rough-legged, Swainson's\nand Ferruginous Hawks all have black plumage morphs that could superficially\nresemble a Zone-tailed Hawk. Thus, a claim of Zone-tailed Hawk in our region\nnecessarily must first eliminate ALL other possibilities; not just Turkey\nVulture. Figure 70. dark morph Short-tailed Hawk Figure 71. dark morph Broad-winged Hawk Figure 72. light morph Short-tailed Hawk Short-tailed Hawk ( Buteo brachyurus ) – Unrecorded in the Carolinas,\nthis species has occurred in Georgia less than 30 miles from the South Carolina\nborder. Though that individual was a light-phase bird, some 80% of Short-tailed\nHawks in Florida are dark and the possibility remains that “lightning could\nstrike twice.” Compared with the other contenders mentioned, Short-tailed is\nsmall and proportionally short-winged (not actually so “short-tailed”). Dark\nphase birds are entirely black except for white under-flight and tail feathers,\nthe latter being thinly banded with a wider sub-terminal band (Figure 70). However,\na small black-bodied Buteo is not automatically Short-tailed. Although exceedingly\nrare especially in the east, there is an east coast record of dark phase\nBroad-winged Hawk (Figure 71) which would be very difficult to eliminate by\nplumage alone. However, the one reliable difference is in counting the number\nof notched primaries (“fingers”); Broad-winged has four, Short-tailed has five.\nWith adult birds, at least, the tail banding is also different. Dark\nShort-tailed has multiple fine dark tail bands and a wide terminal band.\nBroad-winged has a dark tail with a broad white central band (usually one). Light\nPhase Short-tailed is a much easier call. Birds have a pure white body and\nunderwings that contrast with a dark brown hood and darker flight feathers\nrespectively (Figure 72). The head is dark brown with a white throat and face,\nthus a dark “helmet.” Other than Swainson's, no other hawk that would likely occur\nin our area, combines darker flight feathers with white under-wing linings. By\ncomparison, Swainson's is much larger with a vastly different wing shape and\n(in most cases) a solid brown chest (not a helmet). FALCONRY Figure 73. Harris's Hawk The\nancient sport of falconry – the keeping and training of birds of prey for\nhunting – remains prevalent throughout the United States. While sentiments pro vs.\ncon about the sport can become emotional, neither position is assumed here. Regardless,\nit is true that on occasion, falconer's birds escape and sometimes those birds\nare regionally “exotic” species. It would be impractical, if not impossible to\ncover the breadth of possible escapes, but one species, by virtue of its\npopularity, merits brief consideration: Harris's\nHawk ( Parabuteo unicinctus ) .\nThis tropical species not only is a popular bird in falconry circles, it is a\nrelatively common resident of southern Texas and the southwest. Harris's\nHawks are predominantly dark gray with cinnamon upper-wing coverts, under-wings\nand thighs. They have white under-tail coverts and a white base to an otherwise\nlong, black tail with white tip (Figure 73). Young birds (which mature after\none year so not commonly seen as falconer's birds) are streaked below but\notherwise resemble adults with cinnamon upper-wings and rufous (barred)\nthighs. OTHER POSSIBILITIES If\nall this is not enough, a first-year Great Black Hawk ( Buteogallus urubitinga ) has occurred in the eastern United States. First sighted in April, 2018 at South\nPadre Island, Texas, it was relocated later that August in eastern Maine,\ncontinuing there through January 2019 (when it was found with frostbitten feet\nand had to be euthanized). This event highlights just how bizarre the\npossibilities may be. In addition, for many years starting in the early 1970's\nand possibly continuing through present, one or more Black Hawks of unsettled\nspecific identity (Common vs. Crab, vs. Great) have occurred in and around\nMiami, Florida (north to Greynold's Park, North Miami\nBeach). The origins of these birds are unclear and so far, none has been\nrecorded north of that narrow region of occurrence. SUMMARY Hawk-watching\nholds a special place in the world of birding and perhaps except for pelagic\nbirding, is unparalleled as a birding specialty. The entirety of North America,\nincluding the Carolinas, is peppered with organized hawk-watching stations,\nmostly to record the fall migration. With few exceptions, the stars of these\nstations are Buteos, predominantly Broad-winged Hawks in early fall (e.g., September)\nand Red-tailed Hawks later (October-November). Winter in the Carolinas,\npresents an excellent opportunity for hawk-watching, especially along the\ncoastal plain where large numbers of Red-tails congregate and are sometimes\naccompanied by rarities (usually Rough-legged and Swainson's although Harlan's\nand Krider's have been seen). This is what makes\ngaining proficiency at the identification of this group fun. Then, for those\nwho truly like to be challenged, invest time sorting through the myriad of Red-tailed\nHawks for different morphs (subspecies). They're out there for the patient\nstudent of the group. My only word in conclusion is to exercise caution when\nclaiming anything that is uncommon or rare. This group is incredibly variable\nand can cause confusion at any turn. Do not be ashamed of concluding that a\nparticular individual could not be identified. Even the most veteran\nhawk-watchers cannot identify every single bird they see."

    "html": "Lesson 35: Universal Gravitation Lesson 35: Universal Gravitation Remember a few weeks ago we were talking about Sir Isaac Newton and his goal to figure out gravity… the whole “apple” thing. It seems like we got sidetracked a bit, since we talked about his three laws (Lessons 15 , 16 , 17 ), but those really have (apparently) little to do with gravity. About all we did do is write the formula F g = mg , but that doesn’t explain gravity. Newton actually did try to explain gravity itself, and was partially successful, with his Law of Universal Gravitation . Newton started with the idea that since the Earth is pulling on the apple, the apple must also be pulling on the Earth ( Newton’s 3rd Law ). Ask a person on the street where gravity comes from in this situation, and they'd probably say \"the Earth\". They would never consider the apple as a \"source\" of gravity. But if the apple is pulling on the Earth, that must mean that an object doesn’t have to be huge to have a gravitational pull on other objects. There is nothing special about the Earth compared to the apple... both are sources of gravity. That would mean that one apple should be able to have a gravitational pull on another apple… that means any mass pulls on any other mass . The reason we don’t see the effect of, for example, you being pulled towards your computer mouse, is that the masses are so small that the force is also very small. Still, the force is there, and Newton wanted to come up with a way of calculating it. Using a lot of calculus and some pretty tough physics he came up with this formula: F g = force due to gravity between the two objects (N) G = the Gravitational Constant m 1 and m 2 = the two masses (kg) r = the distance between the two objects’ centres (m) This formula shows that any objects with mass will pull towards each other with a gravitational force. You might have heard the phrase \" sphere of influence \" in a Social Studies class. It usually refers to one country having a political or military influence over another. We usually say that an object has a gravitational field around it. Any field is just a sphere of influence around the object. The closer you get, the more you are affected by it. In the case of gravity, the bigger the mass of the object, the bigger the field . The formula also shows that the closer the objects are, the greater the effect of the gravitational field. This is the first formula that you'll see from a family of formulas called the \" inverse square formulas \". They all look pretty much the same, and lead physicists to believe that there are many common connections and relationships throughout all of physics. Newton then turned his attention to trying to find the value for the Gravitational Constant, “G”. Nope, it isn’t the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, 9.81m/s 2 . Newton looked for a way of calculating the value for G from the formula above. If we solve that formula for G we get: Let’s look at how we will substitute numbers into this formula. Newton realized that the only thing he could measure a F g for would be an object on Earth’s surface. An example would be you. We could calculate the force due to gravity on your body easily using F g = mg. We need to know the distance from the centre of the Earth to your centre… which we do have: 6.38e6 m. And yup, they even had a pretty good estimate of this in Newton's time! We need to know your mass, which would be m 1 … that’s no problem. The last thing we need, m 2 , is the mass of the Earth. Oh, oh. That one is a problem. In Newton’s time no one had any idea how heavy the Earth really was. If we knew G, then we could calculate the mass of the Earth, but that’s what we are trying to calculate here! Newton continued to look for some way to calculate G indirectly, but never found a way. Henry Cavendish About a 100 years later a man named Henry Cavendish finally figured out a way to measure the value for G. Cavendish's Torsion Balance He attached a really heavy pair of metal balls to the ends of a long metal rod, and then hung the rod from a wire. He then brought another pair of really heavy metal balls near the balls on the rod. Cavendish knew that because they had mass they should pull on each other, but very weakly. To measure this weak pull, he carefully measured how much the wire was twisting (torque) whenever he brought the other masses near by. This is why the device he used is called a torsion balance . After a lot of very careful, very tedious tries, he found that G was 6.67e-11Nm 2 /kg 2 . Cavendish realized that because he knew the value for G, he could now calculate the mass of the Earth. That’s why he titled the paper that he published “ Weighing the Earth .” Example 1 : Using values that you now know, determine the mass of the Earth. We know that the force exerted on my body by the Earth is F g = mg , where little “m” is my mass. I also know that the force could be found using Newton's big Universal Gravitation Formula, where one mass is a little “m” (my mass), and the other mass is a big “M e ” (the mass of the Earth). F g = F g M e = 5.99e24 kg Notice that we were able to combine a couple of formulas to get the new formula . M e does not always have to be the mass of the Earth. It could be the mass of the moon, Mars, an asteroid, whatever! It let’s you calculate the acceleration due to gravity on that object if you know the other values. Example 2 : The planet Mars has a mass of 6.42e23 kg and a radius (from its centre to the surface) of 3.38e6 m. How much would a 60 kg person weigh on Mars compared to their weight on Earth? Determine How heavy he would “feel” he weighed in kilograms on Mars. On Earth the person has a weight of… F g = mg = (60kg) (9.81m/s 2 ) F g = 5.9e2 N Gravity on Mars can be found using the formula shown above. Note: On an exam you need to show how you got this formula. g = 3.75m/s 2 So that person’s weight on Mars will be… F g = mg = (60kg) (3.75m/s 2 ) F g = 2.3e2 N Remember, mass never truly changes... it's a constant. This is just how much you would feel like, in measurements you can better understand. To figure out how much he would feel like he weighed on Mars in kilograms, remember that we spend our lives here on Earth and our body thinks that 9.81m/s 2 is what gravity should always be. Therefore, this person will feel like his mass is… F g = mg m = F g / g = (2.3e2 N) / (9.81m/s 2 ) m = 23 kg Example 3 : Determine the force of attraction between a 15.0kg box and a 63.0 kg person if they are 3.45m apart. I have to assume that the distance I have been given is the distance between the two centres of the objects. F g = = 5.30e-9 N In the end, Newton still hasn’t really explained why there is gravity, or how it actually works , but he did create a formula that shows how gravity can be calculated as a force between pairs of objects. You need to jump ahead to the 1900’s (and even present day) to get even a bit of an explanation of what gravity really is.",

Newton looked for a way of calculating the value for G from the formula above. If we solve that formula for G we get: Let’s look at how we will substitute numbers into this formula. Newton realized that the only thing he could measure a F g for would be an object on Earth’s surface. An example would be you. We could calculate the force due to gravity on your body easily using F g = mg. We need to know the distance from the centre of the Earth to your centre… which we do have: 6.38e6 m. And yup, they even had a pretty good estimate of this in Newton's time! We need to know your mass, which would be m 1 … that’s no problem. The last thing we need, m 2 , is the mass of the Earth. Oh, oh. That one is a problem. In Newton’s time no one had any idea how heavy the Earth really was. If we knew G, then we could calculate the mass of the Earth, but that’s what we are trying to calculate here! Newton continued to look for some way to calculate G indirectly, but never found a way. Henry Cavendish About a 100 years later a man named Henry Cavendish finally figured out a way to measure the value for G. Cavendish's Torsion Balance He attached a really heavy pair of metal balls to the ends of a long metal rod, and then hung the rod from a wire. He then brought another pair of really heavy metal balls near the balls on the rod. Cavendish knew that because they had mass they should pull on each other, but very weakly. To measure this weak pull, he carefully measured how much the wire was twisting (torque) whenever he brought the other masses near by. This is why the device he used is called a torsion balance . After a lot of very careful, very tedious tries, he found that G was 6.67e-11Nm 2 /kg 2 . Cavendish realized that because he knew the value for G, he could now calculate the mass of the Earth. That’s why he titled the paper that he published “ Weighing the Earth .” Example 1 : Using values that you now know, determine the mass of the Earth. We know that the force exerted on my body by the Earth is F g = mg , where little “m” is my mass. I also know that the force could be found using Newton's big Universal Gravitation Formula, where one mass is a little “m” (my mass), and the other mass is a big “M e ” (the mass of the Earth). F g = F g M e = 5.99e24 kg Notice that we were able to combine a couple of formulas to get the new formula . M e does not always have to be the mass of the Earth. It could be the mass of the moon, Mars, an asteroid, whatever! It let’s you calculate the acceleration due to gravity on that object if you know the other values. Example 2 : The planet Mars has a mass of 6.42e23 kg and a radius (from its centre to the surface) of 3.38e6 m. How much would a 60 kg person weigh on Mars compared to their weight on Earth? Determine How heavy he would “feel” he weighed in kilograms on Mars. On Earth the person has a weight of… F g = mg = (60kg) (9.81m/s 2 ) F g = 5.9e2 N Gravity on Mars can be found using the formula shown above. Note: On an exam you need to show how you got this formula. g = 3.75m/s 2 So that person’s weight on Mars will be… F g = mg = (60kg) (3.75m/s 2 ) F g = 2.3e2 N Remember, mass never truly changes... it's a constant. This is just how much you would feel like, in measurements you can better understand. To figure out how much he would feel like he weighed on Mars in kilograms, remember that we spend our lives here on Earth and our body thinks that 9.81m/s 2 is what gravity should always be. Therefore, this person will feel like his mass is… F g = mg m = F g / g = (2.3e2 N) / (9.81m/s 2 ) m = 23 kg Example 3 : Determine the force of attraction between a 15.0kg box and a 63.0 kg person if they are 3.45m apart. I have to assume that the distance I have been given is the distance between the two centres of the objects. F g = = 5.30e-9 N In the end, Newton still hasn’t really explained why there is gravity, or how it actually works , but he did create a formula that shows how gravity can be calculated as a force between pairs of objects. You need to jump ahead to the 1900’s (and even present day) to get even a bit of an explanation of what gravity really is."

See here Toggle the table of contents Price floor From Market Definition A price floor or minimum price is a lower limit placed by a government or regulatory authority on the price (per unit) of a commodity. A price floor is a form of price control . Another form of price control is a price ceiling . There are two types of price floors: Non-binding price floor : This is a price floor that is less than the current market price . Binding price floor : This is a price floor that is greater than the current market price . There are two extreme forms of price floors: A price floor of infinity can be thought of as analogous to making the exchange or selling of the commodity illegal. A price floor of zero (non-inclusive) can be thought of as a requirement that the good cannot be given away for free. Basic theory in perfectly competitive markets As indicated in the title of this section, we assume here that for the good on which the price floor is imposed, its market is perfectly competitive . Non-binding price floor: price floors set below the market price have no effect If the price floor is set below the market price, it has no effect on the market price. Binding price floors: price floors set above the market price cause excess supply A price floor set above the market price causes excess supply , or a surplus, of the good, because suppliers, tempted by the higher prices, increase production, while buyers, put off by the high prices, decide to buy less. This leads to a deadweight loss . The picture below illustrates this. Here, the distance AB measures the surplus when the price floor is set at the price level of the line AB, which is higher than the equilibrium price (i.e., the market price). Basic theory in monopsonistic markets This article or section could be in use of a graph or other visual aid. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. As indicated in the title of this section, we assume here that for the good on which the price floor is imposed, its market is monopsonistic . That is, we assume that there is only one buyer in the market, which is trying to maximize consumer surplus. We also assume that there is no price discrimination in this market; that is, all sellers are paid the same price for the good they are selling. We also invoke the concept of a marginal revenue cost for the buyer. This is the cost, from the buyer's perspective, of buying another unit of the good. We do not just call it the \"marginal cost\", because that generally refers to the cost of producing one additional unit of the good in question. Finally, we refer to the monopsonist's willingness to pay , not a \"demand curve\". This is because the concept of a demand curve technically relies on the existence of perfect competition. Non-binding price floor: price floors set below the market price have no effect If the price floor is set below the market price (the price at which the good is actually sold, not what the price would be in perfect competition), it has no effect on the market price or quantity traded. Binding price floors set below the point at which marginal revenue cost equals willingness to pay increase quantity sold Suppose there is no price floor (or a non-binding price floor) in a monopsonistic market. Then the marginal revenue cost of buying a unit is greater than what sellers would be willing to sell the unit for. The reason why is that not only must the monopsonist pay for the additional unit, they also now have to pay the higher price for all the other units they buy . (As stated above, here we assume that there is no price discrimination.) So if, for example, the supply schedule for a good is $1 for one unit, $2 for two units, $3 for 3 units, et cetera , the marginal revenue cost of buying a third unit is actually $5, not just $3. Instead of spending $4 to buy two units, the monopsonist would be spending $9 to buy three units. The monopsonist will choose to buy units until the marginal revenue cost of buying another unit exceeds their willingness to pay for that unit. Since they have absolute market power , the monopolist can set the price they pay, and so the market price will equal whatever the seller is willing to accept for the last unit described. However, now suppose a price floor is imposed that is between the prevailing market price and the point at which the monopsonist's marginal revenue cost equals its willingness to pay. The monopsonist's effective marginal revenue cost curve shifts. For the first unit, its marginal revenue cost is equal to the price floor. For units after the first unit, as long as the price floor exceeds the supply curve, the marginal revenue cost still equals the price floor . The reason is that the monopsonist can still buy another unit at a rate equal to the price floor without having to pay a higher price for any other units (because those units would have to be bought at the price floor as well). So the monopolist will still buy units until its marginal revenue cost exceeds its willingness to pay, but its effective marginal revenue cost curve has shifted downwards . The result is that they will choose to buy more units than they did before the price floor was imposed. The prevailing market price will also increase. The effect on total surplus is positive, as the price floor removes some of the deadweight loss from the monopsony. Binding price floors set above the point at which marginal revenue cost equals willingness to pay cause excess supply A binding price floor set above the point at which the original marginal revenue cost curve exceeds willingness to pay will shift the marginal revenue cost curve, but it will shift it upward. Namely, marginal revenue cost will be equal to the price floor until the price floor no longer exceeds what sellers are willing to sell the good for. This causes the monopsonist to buy fewer units as the marginal revenue cost of the good increases. Also, sellers will want to sell more units at this price, creating an excess supply of the good in question. This adds to the deadweight loss from the monopsony. A binding price floor set at the point where willingness to pay intersects the supply curve maximizes total surplus If this example were in perfect competition, the willingness to pay curve would be called the demand curve instead. A price floor set at the point described causes the monopsonist to purchase units until the point at which the monopsonist's willingness to pay no longer exceeds what the suppliers will accept for their goods. This is the quantity traded and price which would exist in the case of perfect competition, and so total surplus is maximized. This eliminates all deadweight loss caused by the monopsony. Effects of price floors Regulatory agency may buy up the surplus The regulatory agency setting the price floor may agree to purchase all excess inventory. Non-price competition among sellers Lower effective prices by means of additional services (a form of non-price competition ) or special discounts and rebates on related products.

Visit ➢ Periodic table For future use, bookmark this Periodic table or visit “PeriodicTableGuide.com” What exactly is the Electron Configuration? Electron configuration is the structure which describes the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of an atom. This is how the electrons are arranged around the nucleus of an atom. In simple words, if we know the electron configuration of an element, then we can easily get the idea of how the electrons are arranged around the atom. What are orbitals? There are few regions around the nucleus where the probability of finding electrons is maximum. Such regions are known as orbitals . For example, here you can see that the blue and yellow color regions around the nucleus show a maximum probability of finding the electrons. These regions around the nucleus are known as orbitals or subshells. There are total 4 orbitals. s-orbitals p-orbitals d-orbitals f-orbitals Why is Electron configuration important? Electronic configuration is important in the following ways. Electron configuration is very important to know where the electrons are located around the atoms. Number of electrons present in s, p, d and f orbitals can be found using electron configuration. Through electronic configuration, the chemical properties of elements can be predicted by knowing their valence electrons . What does 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 mean? 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 simply indicates the following things. 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 The number 1, 2 and 2 (in red color) indicates the Principal quantum number. 1 represents the 1st shell, and 2 represents the 2nd shell. 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 The s and p indicates that the electrons are lying in that orbitals. 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 The 2, 2 and 6 (in red color) are the number of electrons present in that particular orbitals Here, 2 electrons are in s-orbitals of 1st energy shell. Similarly, other 2 electrons are in s-orbitals of the 2nd energy shell, and 6 electrons are in p-orbitals.

Visit ➢ Periodic table For future use, bookmark this Periodic table or visit “PeriodicTableGuide.com” What exactly is the Electron Configuration? Electron configuration is the structure which describes the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of an atom. This is how the electrons are arranged around the nucleus of an atom. In simple words, if we know the electron configuration of an element, then we can easily get the idea of how the electrons are arranged around the atom. What are orbitals? There are few regions around the nucleus where the probability of finding electrons is maximum. Such regions are known as orbitals . For example, here you can see that the blue and yellow color regions around the nucleus show a maximum probability of finding the electrons. These regions around the nucleus are known as orbitals or subshells. There are total 4 orbitals. s-orbitals p-orbitals d-orbitals f-orbitals Why is Electron configuration important? Electronic configuration is important in the following ways. Electron configuration is very important to know where the electrons are located around the atoms. Number of electrons present in s, p, d and f orbitals can be found using electron configuration. Through electronic configuration, the chemical properties of elements can be predicted by knowing their valence electrons . What does 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 mean? 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 simply indicates the following things. 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 The number 1, 2 and 2 (in red color) indicates the Principal quantum number. 1 represents the 1st shell, and 2 represents the 2nd shell. 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 p 6 The s and p indicates that the electrons are lying in that orbitals. 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 The 2, 2 and 6 (in red color) are the number of electrons present in that particular orbitals Here, 2 electrons are in s-orbitals of 1st energy shell. Similarly, other 2 electrons are in s-orbitals of the 2nd energy shell, and 6 electrons are in p-orbitals.

    "html": "Topology: One-Point Compactification and Locally Compact Spaces | Mathematics and Such Mathematics and Such Just mathematics – Olympiad or otherwise Skip to content Home About This Blog Contents ← Topology: Finite Intersection Property (Omake) Topology: Connected Spaces → Topology: One-Point Compactification and Locally Compact Spaces Posted on March 3, 2013 by limsup Compactifications There’re lots of similarities between completeness and compactness , beyond the superficial resemblance of the words. For example, a closed subset of a compact (resp. complete) space is also compact (resp. complete). Two differences though: compactness is a topological concept while completeness depends on the underlying metric; compact metric spaces are complete ( proposition 4 here ) but not vice versa. [ Intuitively, complete metric spaces can become unbounded and thus fail to be compact. But merely boundedness is not enough to ensure compactness, since any metric can be massaged to a bounded one without affecting the underlying topology . Indeed, it turns out a metric space is compact if and only if it’s complete and totally bounded . We won’t prove that here, but the interested reader may attempt it (it’s not too hard). ] Also, any metric space can be “filled out” to give a completion. Likewise, can we compactify a general topological space? Definition . A compactification of a topological space X is a compact space Y containing X, such that is a dense subspace of Y. Upon doing that, we immediately run into the problem of uniqueness, i.e. the completion is unique while the compactification isn’t. E.g. (0, 1) can be compactified to give both [0, 1] and the unit circle Nonetheless, let’s continue exploring compactifications. The easiest way is to add just one point. One-Point Compactifications Task . Given a topological space X, we wish to construct a compact space Y by appending one point: This is called a one-point compactification of X. Examples. A one-point compactification of (0, 1) (or R ) is given by the circle in the plane. A one-point compactification of [0, 1) is given by [0, 1]. A one-point compactification of is given by the union of two circles which are tangent to each other. A one-point compactification of the plane R 2 is given by the 2-sphere in 3-space. Describing the Topology of Y What would the topology of Y look like? We’ll start by making a reasonable assumption: that X is open in Y (i.e. {∞} is closed in Y ). Now, given any open subset V of Y . If then V is an open subset of Y contained in X , so V is open in X . If , then C := Y – V is closed in X . Also C is compact since it’s a closed subset of the compact space Y . This inspires us to define open subsets of Y as follows: not containing ∞ : open subsets U of X , or containing ∞ : sets Y – C , where C is a closed subset of X which is compact. Checking that this gives us a topology. Indeed, a union of sets of the first type is of the first type. A union of sets of the second type is of the second type (it’s compact since ∩ C i is closed is closed in each C i ). Finally, and C ∩ ( X – U ) is closed in X and compact since it’s a closed subset of C . Obviously, X is open in Y and has the subspace topology. Showing that Y is compact. Let be an open cover. Then there’s at least one C j , and Since C j is compact, it has a finite subcover. Together with Y – C j , this forms a finite subcover of Y . Definition . The above construction is called the Alexandroff extension of the space X. It extends X by one point to give a compact space Y. Examples and Properties Suppose X = (0, 1). We map its Alexandroff extension by and Clearly f is continuous outside ∞. For continuity at ∞, an open subset containing (1, 0) must contain the set V of for some ε>0. Then is the set which is open in the Alexandroff extension. Now we’ll finish the proof by a trick. Lemma . If X is a compact space, Y is Hausdorff, and is a bijective continuous map, then f is a homeomorphism. Proof . Continuity means maps closed subsets to closed subsets. It suffices to show f maps closed subsets to closed subsets. But if C is closed in X , then C is compact and thus f ( C ) is compact. Since Y is Hausdorff, f ( C ) is closed in Y . Done. ♦ Let’s take the second example . Map the Alexandroff extension by taking t to itself and ∞ to 1. Once again f is continuous outside ∞. For continuity at ∞, an open subset containing 1 in [0, 1] must also contain V = (1-ε, 1] for some ε>0. But then which is open in the Alexandroff extension. Hence f is continuous and we invoke the above lemma to show that it is a homeomorphism. Let X = Q . Then Y is not Hausdorff since there’re no disjoint open subsets U and V separating 0 and ∞. To see why, replacing an open subset by a smaller one, we may take containing 0. For ∞, we have V = Y – C , for a compact subset C of Q containing U . This means is closed in C and hence also compact, which is impossible by this lemma. Lemma . The subspace for a 0. Thus U contains ( x -ε, x +ε) and its closure [ x -ε, x +ε] which is compact. Thus, R n is locally compact, and so is any open or closed subset of R n . The set X = {1/ n : n = 1, 2, 3, … } is locally compact since it’s discrete. Its closure, given by , is in fact compact. The set of rationals Q is not locally compact since it’s Hausdorff but its Alexandroff extension is not. Exercise Is it true that if f : X → Y is continuous and X is locally compact, then so is Y ? [ Recall that this is true if we replace “locally compact” by “compact”. ] Answer (Highlight to read) No, take X = Q with the discrete topology and Y = Q as a subspace of R . Then the identity map f : X → Y is continuous but Y = f ( X ) is not locally compact. ♦ Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Like Loading...

Reply Kirtan says: April 25, 2020 at 9:05 am This blog is far better than Munkres topology. Amazing work. Though I like to point out a error. Image of complete metric space under uniformly continious map is not complete. For e.g. take identity map form (0,1) to (0,1). Let domain be endowed with discrete metric and co domain be endowed with standard metric. identity map is uniformly continious.

For example, a closed subset of a compact (resp. complete) space is also compact (resp. complete). Two differences though: compactness is a topological concept while completeness depends on the underlying metric; compact metric spaces are complete ( proposition 4 here ) but not vice versa. [ Intuitively, complete metric spaces can become unbounded and thus fail to be compact. But merely boundedness is not enough to ensure compactness, since any metric can be massaged to a bounded one without affecting the underlying topology . Indeed, it turns out a metric space is compact if and only if it’s complete and totally bounded . We won’t prove that here, but the interested reader may attempt it (it’s not too hard). ] Also, any metric space can be “filled out” to give a completion. Likewise, can we compactify a general topological space? Definition . A compactification of a topological space X is a compact space Y containing X, such that is a dense subspace of Y. Upon doing that, we immediately run into the problem of uniqueness, i.e. the completion is unique while the compactification isn’t. E.g. (0, 1) can be compactified to give both [0, 1] and the unit circle Nonetheless, let’s continue exploring compactifications. The easiest way is to add just one point. One-Point Compactifications Task . Given a topological space X, we wish to construct a compact space Y by appending one point: This is called a one-point compactification of X. Examples. A one-point compactification of (0, 1) (or R ) is given by the circle in the plane. A one-point compactification of [0, 1) is given by [0, 1]. A one-point compactification of is given by the union of two circles which are tangent to each other. A one-point compactification of the plane R 2 is given by the 2-sphere in 3-space. Describing the Topology of Y What would the topology of Y look like? We’ll start by making a reasonable assumption: that X is open in Y (i.e. {∞} is closed in Y ). Now, given any open subset V of Y . If then V is an open subset of Y contained in X , so V is open in X . If , then C := Y – V is closed in X . Also C is compact since it’s a closed subset of the compact space Y . This inspires us to define open subsets of Y as follows: not containing ∞ : open subsets U of X , or containing ∞ : sets Y – C , where C is a closed subset of X which is compact. Checking that this gives us a topology. Indeed, a union of sets of the first type is of the first type. A union of sets of the second type is of the second type (it’s compact since ∩ C i is closed is closed in each C i ). Finally, and C ∩ ( X – U ) is closed in X and compact since it’s a closed subset of C . Obviously, X is open in Y and has the subspace topology. Showing that Y is compact. Let be an open cover. Then there’s at least one C j , and Since C j is compact, it has a finite subcover. Together with Y – C j , this forms a finite subcover of Y . Definition . The above construction is called the Alexandroff extension of the space X. It extends X by one point to give a compact space Y. Examples and Properties Suppose X = (0, 1). We map its Alexandroff extension by and Clearly f is continuous outside ∞. For continuity at ∞, an open subset containing (1, 0) must contain the set V of for some ε>0. Then is the set which is open in the Alexandroff extension. Now we’ll finish the proof by a trick. Lemma . If X is a compact space, Y is Hausdorff, and is a bijective continuous map, then f is a homeomorphism. Proof . Continuity means maps closed subsets to closed subsets. It suffices to show f maps closed subsets to closed subsets. But if C is closed in X , then C is compact and thus f ( C ) is compact. Since Y is Hausdorff, f ( C ) is closed in Y . Done. ♦ Let’s take the second example . Map the Alexandroff extension by taking t to itself and ∞ to 1. Once again f is continuous outside ∞. For continuity at ∞, an open subset containing 1 in [0, 1] must also contain V = (1-ε, 1] for some ε>0. But then which is open in the Alexandroff extension. Hence f is continuous and we invoke the above lemma to show that it is a homeomorphism. Let X = Q . Then Y is not Hausdorff since there’re no disjoint open subsets U and V separating 0 and ∞. To see why, replacing an open subset by a smaller one, we may take containing 0. For ∞, we have V = Y – C , for a compact subset C of Q containing U . This means is closed in C and hence also compact, which is impossible by this lemma. Lemma . The subspace for a 0. Thus U contains ( x -ε, x +ε) and its closure [ x -ε, x +ε] which is compact. Thus, R n is locally compact, and so is any open or closed subset of R n . The set X = {1/ n : n = 1, 2, 3, … } is locally compact since it’s discrete. Its closure, given by , is in fact compact. The set of rationals Q is not locally compact since it’s Hausdorff but its Alexandroff extension is not. Exercise Is it true that if f : X → Y is continuous and X is locally compact, then so is Y ? [ Recall that this is true if we replace “locally compact” by “compact”. ] Answer (Highlight to read) No, take X = Q with the discrete topology and Y = Q as a subspace of R . Then the identity map f : X → Y is continuous but Y = f ( X ) is not locally compact. ♦ Share this: Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Like Loading...

Well, that's not always the case... by Tudor Tarita February 12, 2024 - Updated on April 8, 2024 in Dinosaurs A A A A Reset Edited and reviewed by Tibi Puiu Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Submit to Reddit Only for illustrative purposes, featured dinosaurs are not accurately represented. Credit: DALL-E 3. When we think of dinosaurs, colossal creatures, huge teeth, horns, and bony plates come to mind. Yet, that is not always the case. An equally fascinating and lesser-known aspect of dinosaur diversity is their size range, extending to some surprisingly small members. This article delves into ten of the smallest dinosaurs ever described, showcasing their unique adaptations and ecological niches. From arboreal dinosaurs to insect and fish hunters, let’s meet these long-gone critters. 1. Oculudentavis: “Eye Tooth Bird” Family Lepidosauria Found in Angbamo site, Myanmar Diet Carnivorous Lived ~98 mya Length 1.7 cm Height n/a Weight estimate 28 g Amber preserved specimen of Occulodentavis with 3D scan. Credit: Wikimedia Commons Oculudentavis is a subject of scientific intrigue, initially believed to be the smallest dinosaur. The confusion arose from Oculudentavis ‘ bird-like features, such as a large eye cavity and a beak-like snout. However, closer examination revealed numerous lizard-like characteristics. The dinosaur had teeth fused to the jaw and specific skull bone shapes not found in birds. It also had a high tooth count and lacked an antorbital fenestra (an opening in the skull that is in front of the eye sockets), typical of avialan dinosaurs . However, scaly skin patches on its skull align more with lepidosaurs. Oculudentavis lived in the lush, tropical forests of what is now Myanmar. This particular specimen became encapsulated in amber around 99 million years ago. It lived in a warm, humid climate alongside a variety of flora and fauna, with insects and small vertebrates which comprising its diet. Despite the controversy surrounding its classification as a dinosaur, Oculudentavis is a notable mention for this list. 2. Anchiornis: “Near Bird” Family Anchiornithidae Found in Tiaojishan Formation, China Diet Carnivorous Lived ~160 mya Length 60 cm Height 34 cm Weight estimate 1 kg Artist’s recreation of Anchiornis . Credit: UnexpectedDinoLesson/Wikimedia Commons Anchiornis made its first appearance during the Late Jurassic period. Discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning, China, this small, bird-like dinosaur is often dubbed one of the missing links between reptiles and birds​ ​. This bipedal theropod boasted a triangular skull, akin to dromaeosaurids and troodontids . Anchiornis featured long, vaned feathers on the wings, legs, and tail with simpler feathers covering the rest of its body. Anchiornis also sported long feathers possibly forming a crest on its head, suggesting it had a “shaggier” plumage compared to modern birds​ ​. Anchiornis lived in lush forest areas around deep lakes and mountain streams. Its diet likely consisted of small lizards and fish, as shown by fossilized gastric pellets. While initially thought to be capable of flight, further research suggests that while juveniles might achieve powered flight , adults likely used their wings to assist in running, leaping, and possibly even gliding​ ​​ ​. Anchiornis ‘ plumage had contrasting white and black feathers which might have aided in predator evasion, akin to the dazzle camouflage seen in zebras​. 3. Microraptor: “Micro Thief” Family Dromaeosauridae Found in Liaoning, China Diet Carnivorous Lived 125-120 mya Length 1.2 m Height 77 cm Weight estimate 1 kg Artist’s recreation of Microraptor . Credit: Fred Wierum/Wikimedia Commons Microraptor , a crow-sized theropod with a four-winged design, lived during the Early Cretaceous period , approximately 125 million years ago. Discovered in China, Microraptor’s most striking feature was its feathers on all four limbs, suggesting the ability to glide. This dinosaur weighed around one kilogram and had a wingspan of about 70 centimeters. Its iridescent black plumage was similar to modern birds and could have been used for display and sexual behavior​ ​​ ​.

Its diet likely included small vertebrates like reptiles, mammals, fish, and primitive birds. The discovery of mammal bones in a Microraptor’s abdomen highlights its predatory nature. Its large eyes and sharp, pointed teeth suggest it was a hunter, capable of ambush tactics. Microraptor might have used its agility and potentially its flight capabilities to capture prey, navigating the forest canopy with ease​ ​. 4. Parvicursor: “Small Runner” Family Alvarezsauridae Found in Barun Goyot Formation, Mongolia Diet Carnivorous Lived ~72 mya Length 39 cm Height ~25 cm Weight estimate 162 g Artist’s recreation of Parvicursor . Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Parvicursor was a genus of diminutive maniraptoran with odd one-claw hands and long slender legs adapted for fast running. It was one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs, measuring only about 39 centimeters in length and as heavy as 162 grams. Its fossils, discovered in the Barun Goyot formation of Mongolia, indicate a creature adapted to quick, agile movements, either for evading predators or catching prey​ ​​ ​. This tiny carnivore lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 72 million years ago. Parvicursor apparently had a highly specialized lifestyle, despite being as large as a parrot. Its leg and hip anatomy suggests an ability to sprint with high-speed maneuverability necessary for survival in its environment. The specific adaptations of its one-claw hands suggest a complex behavior pattern. These hands might have possibly helped with social interactions, although much of this remains speculative due to limited fossil evidence​. While only one specimen of Parvicursor has been found, its morphology suggests a diet primarily consisting of insects. 5. Epidexipteryx: “Display Feather” Family Scansoriopterygidae Found in Daohugou, Mongolia Diet Carnivorous Lived 168-152 mya Length 45 cm Height ~25 cm Weight estimate 164 g Artist’s recreation of Epidexipteryx . Credit: Conty/Wikimedia Commons Epidexipteryx is a small theropod found to have unique ornamental feathers, particularly four long feathers on its tail. These feathers were not for flight but likely for display and insulation, indicating a behavior possibly related to social status. It only measured about 45 centimeters including the tail feathers, and weighed around 164 grams. Its skull featured a short snout with sharp teeth adapted for predation. The small dinosaur’s hands possessed long digits, characteristic of paravian dinosaurs, aiding in climbing​ ​​ ​. The diet of Epidexipteryx consisted mainly of small insects, worms, and larvae, matching its small stature. Epidexipteryx lived during the Middle to Late Jurassic Period , 168 to 152 million years ago, in present-day Mongolia. This dinosaur lived in forest areas, using its climbing abilities and potentially gliding from tree to tree. Despite lacking the capability for powered flight, the structure of its limbs suggests it was adapted to an arboreal life​ ​​ ​. 6. Mei Long: “Soundly Sleeping Dragon” Family Troodontidae Found in Yixian Formation, China Diet Carnivorous Lived ~125 mya Length ~53 cm (juvenile) Height n/a Weight estimate n/a Artist’s recreation of Mei Long . Credit: Matt Martyniuk/Wikimedia Commons Mei Long , translating to “Soundly Sleeping Dragon” in Chinese, was a duck-sized troodontid dinosaur from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago. The dinosaur’s fossil posture in which it was found, in a bird-like sleeping posture, with its head tucked under a forelimb, has baffled paleontologists. This posture, similar to the roosting position of modern birds, suggests behavioral connections between extinct dinosaurs and birds. The fossil’s 3D preservation was likely due to rapid burial in volcanic ash, possibly after being overcome by poisonous gases from a volcanic eruption​ ​​ ​​ ​. The discovery of Mei Long suggests that some non-avian dinosaurs, like their avian descendants, also exhibited warm-blooded characteristics. Mei Long had several unique features, including large nares and a set of closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw. These features, along with its bird-like hip structure, place Mei Long near the base of the troodontid family. Thus, the “dragon” was likely behaviorally advanced and intelligent, with keen senses. Mei Long’s diet likely included small lizards and insects, and its long legs suggest it was a fast runner, possibly using trees for shelter from larger predators​ ​. 7. Bambiraptor: “Juvenile Thief” Family Dromaeosauridae Found in Glacier National Park, Montana Diet Carnivorous Lived 72-70 mya Length 90 cm Height ~30 cm Weight estimate 2 kg Artist’s recreation of Bambiraptor. Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Bambiraptor , a small, bird-like dinosaur, lived around 72-70 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period. Wes Linster discovered this dinosaur when he was only 14 years old in 1993 in Glacier National Park, Montana. Bambiraptor’s has one of the most complete skeletons ever found, a staggering 95% complete fossil. The “Bambi” in its name actually refers to the young age of the first specimen that was found. Therefore, a more accurate translation of the name would be “Juvenile Thief”. Bambiraptor , primarily known from a juvenile specimen, had a length of about 90 centimeters. It had an estimated total length of one meter, and likely weighed around two kilograms. Bambirapto r was a swift runner with bird-like features, such as its very long arms with a well-developed wishbone. The holotype specimen’s brain size was within the lower range of modern birds, suggesting higher intelligence and agility akin to dromaeosaurids. Research indicates that Bambiraptor might have had the ability to “hold” food with its front limbs and bring it to its mouth. Its diet likely consisted of insects, dinosaur eggs, small reptiles, or mammals, fitting its carnivorous nature. 8. Micropachycephalosaurus: “Micro Thick-Headed Lizard” Family Ceratopsia Found in Jiangjunding Formation, China Diet Herbivorous Lived ~70 mya Length 1 m Height ~30 cm Weight estimate 10-15 kg Artist’s recreation of Micropachycephalosaurus . Credit: DarkWerewolf/Wikimedia Commons Micropachycephalosaurus , translating to “micro thick-headed lizard,” was a genus of small, herbivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago. It is notable for being one of the smallest dinosaurs ever discovered and for having the longest name of any dinosaur​ ​​ ​. Despite its name suggesting a relation to Pachycephalosaurs , Micropachycephalosaurus is classified within the Ceratopsian group. Scientists estimate this dinosaur was to have grown about two meters long and weighed around 10 to 15 kilograms. It featured a thick skull, flattened side to side, with large eye sockets and a short snout. Micropachycephalosaurus was a herbivore, using its column-like teeth with vertical ridges to grind tough plant material. Evidence suggests that it had social behavior, living in herds or groups. It may have used its thick skull in head-butting contests, possibly for mating rituals or establishing dominance within its group​ ​. 9. Compsognathus: “Pretty Jaw” Family Compsognathidae Found in Bavaria, Germany Diet Carnivorous Lived 150 mya Length 1 m Height 0.3 m Weight estimate 3 kg Artist’s recreation of Compsognathus . Credit: Nobu Tamura/Wikimedia Commons Compsognathus , the “Pretty jaw,” is a small theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic. Paleontologists first described this dinosaur from two nearly complete skeletons, found in Germany and France. It was the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton​ ​. The one-meter-long Compsognathus was once considered the smallest-known non-avian dinosaur. It was a carnivore, feeding mainly on small animals. Its diet is known with certainty thanks to the preserved remains of small lizards found within the bellies of both known specimens​ ​​ ​. Compsognathus had long, narrow legs, a long tail for balance, and sharp teeth and claws designed for grasping small animals. The German specimen, possibly a juvenile, is smaller than the French specimen, which offers insight into the dinosaur’s growth and size variation. 10. Liaoningosaurus: “Liaoning Lizard” Family Ankylosauridae Found in Liaoning, China Diet Carnivorous Lived 125-119 mya Length 34-40 cm Height n/a Weight estimate n/a Artist’s recreation of Liaoningosaurus . Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Liaoningosaurus , a fascinating genus from the Ankylosauria suborder, hails from the Early Cretaceous period in China’s Liaoning Province. This dinosaur, known specifically as Liaoningosaurus paradoxus , is a paradox for scientists as it is the first carnivorous ornithischian discovered. Initially described in 2001, Liaoningosaurus fossils were unearthed from the Yixian Formation. The type specimen measured only about 34 to 40 centimeters in length. Liaoningosaurus displayed unique features alongside slender teeth with few denticles, suggesting a fish-eating diet. This semi-aquatic lifestyle hypothesis stems from the dinosaur’s skeletal features and the preserved fish skeletons within the gut contents of the holotype, a deviation from the typical herbivorous ankylosaurid​ ​​ ​. Its classification has been debated, but recent analyses suggest Liaoningosaurus as a basal ankylosaurid, although its exact place within this family tree remains under discussion​ ​.

Well, that's not always the case... by Tudor Tarita February 12, 2024 - Updated on April 8, 2024 in Dinosaurs A A A A Reset Edited and reviewed by Tibi Puiu Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Submit to Reddit Only for illustrative purposes, featured dinosaurs are not accurately represented. Credit: DALL-E 3. When we think of dinosaurs, colossal creatures, huge teeth, horns, and bony plates come to mind. Yet, that is not always the case. An equally fascinating and lesser-known aspect of dinosaur diversity is their size range, extending to some surprisingly small members. This article delves into ten of the smallest dinosaurs ever described, showcasing their unique adaptations and ecological niches. From arboreal dinosaurs to insect and fish hunters, let’s meet these long-gone critters. 1. Oculudentavis: “Eye Tooth Bird” Family Lepidosauria Found in Angbamo site, Myanmar Diet Carnivorous Lived ~98 mya Length 1.7 cm Height n/a Weight estimate 28 g Amber preserved specimen of Occulodentavis with 3D scan. Credit: Wikimedia Commons Oculudentavis is a subject of scientific intrigue, initially believed to be the smallest dinosaur. The confusion arose from Oculudentavis ‘ bird-like features, such as a large eye cavity and a beak-like snout. However, closer examination revealed numerous lizard-like characteristics. The dinosaur had teeth fused to the jaw and specific skull bone shapes not found in birds. It also had a high tooth count and lacked an antorbital fenestra (an opening in the skull that is in front of the eye sockets), typical of avialan dinosaurs . However, scaly skin patches on its skull align more with lepidosaurs. Oculudentavis lived in the lush, tropical forests of what is now Myanmar. This particular specimen became encapsulated in amber around 99 million years ago. It lived in a warm, humid climate alongside a variety of flora and fauna, with insects and small vertebrates which comprising its diet. Despite the controversy surrounding its classification as a dinosaur, Oculudentavis is a notable mention for this list. 2. Anchiornis: “Near Bird” Family Anchiornithidae Found in Tiaojishan Formation, China Diet Carnivorous Lived ~160 mya Length 60 cm Height 34 cm Weight estimate 1 kg Artist’s recreation of Anchiornis . Credit: UnexpectedDinoLesson/Wikimedia Commons Anchiornis made its first appearance during the Late Jurassic period. Discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning, China, this small, bird-like dinosaur is often dubbed one of the missing links between reptiles and birds​ ​. This bipedal theropod boasted a triangular skull, akin to dromaeosaurids and troodontids . Anchiornis featured long, vaned feathers on the wings, legs, and tail with simpler feathers covering the rest of its body. Anchiornis also sported long feathers possibly forming a crest on its head, suggesting it had a “shaggier” plumage compared to modern birds​ ​. Anchiornis lived in lush forest areas around deep lakes and mountain streams. Its diet likely consisted of small lizards and fish, as shown by fossilized gastric pellets. While initially thought to be capable of flight, further research suggests that while juveniles might achieve powered flight , adults likely used their wings to assist in running, leaping, and possibly even gliding​ ​​ ​. Anchiornis ‘ plumage had contrasting white and black feathers which might have aided in predator evasion, akin to the dazzle camouflage seen in zebras​. 3. Microraptor: “Micro Thief” Family Dromaeosauridae Found in Liaoning, China Diet Carnivorous Lived 125-120 mya Length 1.2 m Height 77 cm Weight estimate 1 kg Artist’s recreation of Microraptor . Credit: Fred Wierum/Wikimedia Commons Microraptor , a crow-sized theropod with a four-winged design, lived during the Early Cretaceous period , approximately 125 million years ago. Discovered in China, Microraptor’s most striking feature was its feathers on all four limbs, suggesting the ability to glide. This dinosaur weighed around one kilogram and had a wingspan of about 70 centimeters. Its iridescent black plumage was similar to modern birds and could have been used for display and sexual behavior​ ​​ ​.

Yes, really Archaeologists use AI to discover one of the world’s oldest campfires at one-million-year-old site in Israel Microraptor’s abundance in fossil records, with over 300 specimens identified, indicates it must have been very common in its ecosystem. Scientists believe that Microraptor was arboreal , spending much of its time in trees, an adaptation supported by its anatomy which was not well-suited for ground movement​ ​. Get smarter everyday...

Its diet likely included small vertebrates like reptiles, mammals, fish, and primitive birds. The discovery of mammal bones in a Microraptor’s abdomen highlights its predatory nature. Its large eyes and sharp, pointed teeth suggest it was a hunter, capable of ambush tactics. Microraptor might have used its agility and potentially its flight capabilities to capture prey, navigating the forest canopy with ease​ ​. 4. Parvicursor: “Small Runner” Family Alvarezsauridae Found in Barun Goyot Formation, Mongolia Diet Carnivorous Lived ~72 mya Length 39 cm Height ~25 cm Weight estimate 162 g Artist’s recreation of Parvicursor . Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Parvicursor was a genus of diminutive maniraptoran with odd one-claw hands and long slender legs adapted for fast running. It was one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs, measuring only about 39 centimeters in length and as heavy as 162 grams. Its fossils, discovered in the Barun Goyot formation of Mongolia, indicate a creature adapted to quick, agile movements, either for evading predators or catching prey​ ​​ ​. This tiny carnivore lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 72 million years ago. Parvicursor apparently had a highly specialized lifestyle, despite being as large as a parrot. Its leg and hip anatomy suggests an ability to sprint with high-speed maneuverability necessary for survival in its environment. The specific adaptations of its one-claw hands suggest a complex behavior pattern. These hands might have possibly helped with social interactions, although much of this remains speculative due to limited fossil evidence​. While only one specimen of Parvicursor has been found, its morphology suggests a diet primarily consisting of insects. 5. Epidexipteryx: “Display Feather” Family Scansoriopterygidae Found in Daohugou, Mongolia Diet Carnivorous Lived 168-152 mya Length 45 cm Height ~25 cm Weight estimate 164 g Artist’s recreation of Epidexipteryx . Credit: Conty/Wikimedia Commons Epidexipteryx is a small theropod found to have unique ornamental feathers, particularly four long feathers on its tail. These feathers were not for flight but likely for display and insulation, indicating a behavior possibly related to social status. It only measured about 45 centimeters including the tail feathers, and weighed around 164 grams. Its skull featured a short snout with sharp teeth adapted for predation. The small dinosaur’s hands possessed long digits, characteristic of paravian dinosaurs, aiding in climbing​ ​​ ​. The diet of Epidexipteryx consisted mainly of small insects, worms, and larvae, matching its small stature. Epidexipteryx lived during the Middle to Late Jurassic Period , 168 to 152 million years ago, in present-day Mongolia. This dinosaur lived in forest areas, using its climbing abilities and potentially gliding from tree to tree. Despite lacking the capability for powered flight, the structure of its limbs suggests it was adapted to an arboreal life​ ​​ ​. 6. Mei Long: “Soundly Sleeping Dragon” Family Troodontidae Found in Yixian Formation, China Diet Carnivorous Lived ~125 mya Length ~53 cm (juvenile) Height n/a Weight estimate n/a Artist’s recreation of Mei Long . Credit: Matt Martyniuk/Wikimedia Commons Mei Long , translating to “Soundly Sleeping Dragon” in Chinese, was a duck-sized troodontid dinosaur from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning, China, dating back to the Early Cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago. The dinosaur’s fossil posture in which it was found, in a bird-like sleeping posture, with its head tucked under a forelimb, has baffled paleontologists. This posture, similar to the roosting position of modern birds, suggests behavioral connections between extinct dinosaurs and birds. The fossil’s 3D preservation was likely due to rapid burial in volcanic ash, possibly after being overcome by poisonous gases from a volcanic eruption​ ​​ ​​ ​. The discovery of Mei Long suggests that some non-avian dinosaurs, like their avian descendants, also exhibited warm-blooded characteristics. Mei Long had several unique features, including large nares and a set of closely spaced teeth in the lower jaw. These features, along with its bird-like hip structure, place Mei Long near the base of the troodontid family. Thus, the “dragon” was likely behaviorally advanced and intelligent, with keen senses. Mei Long’s diet likely included small lizards and insects, and its long legs suggest it was a fast runner, possibly using trees for shelter from larger predators​ ​. 7. Bambiraptor: “Juvenile Thief” Family Dromaeosauridae Found in Glacier National Park, Montana Diet Carnivorous Lived 72-70 mya Length 90 cm Height ~30 cm Weight estimate 2 kg Artist’s recreation of Bambiraptor. Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Bambiraptor , a small, bird-like dinosaur, lived around 72-70 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period. Wes Linster discovered this dinosaur when he was only 14 years old in 1993 in Glacier National Park, Montana. Bambiraptor’s has one of the most complete skeletons ever found, a staggering 95% complete fossil. The “Bambi” in its name actually refers to the young age of the first specimen that was found. Therefore, a more accurate translation of the name would be “Juvenile Thief”. Bambiraptor , primarily known from a juvenile specimen, had a length of about 90 centimeters. It had an estimated total length of one meter, and likely weighed around two kilograms. Bambirapto r was a swift runner with bird-like features, such as its very long arms with a well-developed wishbone. The holotype specimen’s brain size was within the lower range of modern birds, suggesting higher intelligence and agility akin to dromaeosaurids. Research indicates that Bambiraptor might have had the ability to “hold” food with its front limbs and bring it to its mouth. Its diet likely consisted of insects, dinosaur eggs, small reptiles, or mammals, fitting its carnivorous nature. 8. Micropachycephalosaurus: “Micro Thick-Headed Lizard” Family Ceratopsia Found in Jiangjunding Formation, China Diet Herbivorous Lived ~70 mya Length 1 m Height ~30 cm Weight estimate 10-15 kg Artist’s recreation of Micropachycephalosaurus . Credit: DarkWerewolf/Wikimedia Commons Micropachycephalosaurus , translating to “micro thick-headed lizard,” was a genus of small, herbivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago. It is notable for being one of the smallest dinosaurs ever discovered and for having the longest name of any dinosaur​ ​​ ​. Despite its name suggesting a relation to Pachycephalosaurs , Micropachycephalosaurus is classified within the Ceratopsian group. Scientists estimate this dinosaur was to have grown about two meters long and weighed around 10 to 15 kilograms. It featured a thick skull, flattened side to side, with large eye sockets and a short snout. Micropachycephalosaurus was a herbivore, using its column-like teeth with vertical ridges to grind tough plant material. Evidence suggests that it had social behavior, living in herds or groups. It may have used its thick skull in head-butting contests, possibly for mating rituals or establishing dominance within its group​ ​. 9. Compsognathus: “Pretty Jaw” Family Compsognathidae Found in Bavaria, Germany Diet Carnivorous Lived 150 mya Length 1 m Height 0.3 m Weight estimate 3 kg Artist’s recreation of Compsognathus . Credit: Nobu Tamura/Wikimedia Commons Compsognathus , the “Pretty jaw,” is a small theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago during the Late Jurassic. Paleontologists first described this dinosaur from two nearly complete skeletons, found in Germany and France. It was the first theropod dinosaur known from a reasonably complete fossil skeleton​ ​. The one-meter-long Compsognathus was once considered the smallest-known non-avian dinosaur. It was a carnivore, feeding mainly on small animals. Its diet is known with certainty thanks to the preserved remains of small lizards found within the bellies of both known specimens​ ​​ ​. Compsognathus had long, narrow legs, a long tail for balance, and sharp teeth and claws designed for grasping small animals. The German specimen, possibly a juvenile, is smaller than the French specimen, which offers insight into the dinosaur’s growth and size variation. 10. Liaoningosaurus: “Liaoning Lizard” Family Ankylosauridae Found in Liaoning, China Diet Carnivorous Lived 125-119 mya Length 34-40 cm Height n/a Weight estimate n/a Artist’s recreation of Liaoningosaurus . Credit: PaleoEquii/Wikimedia Commons Liaoningosaurus , a fascinating genus from the Ankylosauria suborder, hails from the Early Cretaceous period in China’s Liaoning Province. This dinosaur, known specifically as Liaoningosaurus paradoxus , is a paradox for scientists as it is the first carnivorous ornithischian discovered. Initially described in 2001, Liaoningosaurus fossils were unearthed from the Yixian Formation. The type specimen measured only about 34 to 40 centimeters in length. Liaoningosaurus displayed unique features alongside slender teeth with few denticles, suggesting a fish-eating diet. This semi-aquatic lifestyle hypothesis stems from the dinosaur’s skeletal features and the preserved fish skeletons within the gut contents of the holotype, a deviation from the typical herbivorous ankylosaurid​ ​​ ​. Its classification has been debated, but recent analyses suggest Liaoningosaurus as a basal ankylosaurid, although its exact place within this family tree remains under discussion​ ​.

    "html": "Color Changing Flowers Science Project Skip to Instructions Skip to content Search Toggle Menu Search Color Changing Flowers Science Project By Rookie Parenting Science Updated On: 12/12/2023 Have you ever wondered what would happen if you changed the color of water that flowers drank? Well, we did, too. The experiment involves placing cut flowers in water dyed with different colors and observing the effect on the color of the flowers. Flowers and plants drink water through their roots. In cut flowers, since there are no roots, water travels from the cut directly into the stems and travels to the petals and other parts of the plant. This is how a flower can turn red if it drinks red water or purple if it drinks purple water. There are three factors that contribute to the transportation of water. Capillary action Inside the stem, there are tube-like transport tissue, called xylem , that brings water and nutrient to different parts of the plant. Water molecules are attracted to the surface of the xylem cells by weak electrical attractions. This sticky property is called adhesion . Water automatically moves up the xylem due to adhesion and the resulting movement is called capillary action ​1​ . Cohesion Water molecules are not only attracted to the surface of xylem (adhesion), but they are also attracted to one another. This property is called cohesion . Because of cohesion, water molecules fill the column in the xylem as they move up and act as a continuous stream of water ​2​ . Transpiration Water evaporates from the plant through transpiration . As water evaporates in the petals or any part of the plant exposed to air, a negative pressure is created in the xylem, resulting in suction pulling the water upward just like you draw water upward when you suck on a straw ​3​ . Through these three properties, color water is transported to the petals and the color shows up in the xylem cells on the petals. Color Changing Flowers Science Project Active Time: 15 minutes Additional Time: 1 day Total Time: 1 day 15 minutes White flowers are great for doing this color changing experiment. They change colors almost overnight. Other types of flowers such as daisies can take a lot longer (more than 10 days). Print Materials white/light-colored flowers such as daisies or white roses food coloring Tools several glasses, vases or test tubes adult supervision Instructions Fill each glass with fresh water from the tap. Put 2-5 drops of food coloring into it, one color each. You can also mix the colors (e.g. blue + yellow = green) to get all the rainbow colors. Trim at least half an inch of stem off the flowers before putting each into the glass and each time you change the water. Add flower food if it is provided. Keep them in a cool place overnight. Observe the change in colors in the petals. If you use flowers such as daisies that take longer to do this experiment, change the water entirely every 2-3 days to keep the flowers fresh for longer. Try this bonus experiment: cut along the stem into two halves and stop before reaching the flower. Insert each half into a different colored water. Observe how the petals change color. After a few days, the white flowers will change into the colors the flowers were immersed in. Did you try this project? Follow us on Pinterest and share a photo!

Latest Official ENSO Update More ENSO Latest ENSO blog ENSO in a nutshell ENSO FAQs Popular El Niño and La Niña images What Is ENSO El Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases of a natural climate pattern across the tropical Pacific known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or “ENSO” for short. The pattern shifts back and forth irregularly every two to seven years, bringing predictable changes in ocean temperature and disrupting the normal wind and rainfall patterns across the tropics. These changes in the seasonal climate of the world's biggest ocean have a cascade of global side effects. More About el Niño What is El Niño in a nutshell?

Their measurements are presented in centimeters (cm) and are precise to two decimal places, for example, 1.23 cm. This guide will cover the essential aspects of reading measurements from a vernier caliper, applicable to models that use inches as well. Main Scale: The main scale is a fixed scale on the caliper and is typically graduated in millimeters or inches, depending on the unit of measurement. Each division on the main scale represents a specific measurement unit, and it provides the whole number part of the measurement. Vernier Scale: The Vernier scale is a secondary scale that slides parallel to the main scale. It has a series of divisions that are slightly smaller than those on the main scale. The zero (0) point on the Vernier scale corresponds to a specific point on the main scale, ensuring alignment during measurements. Alignment: To read the Vernier scale, align the zero (0) point of the Vernier scale with the closest point on the main scale. Look for the first line on the Vernier scale that aligns perfectly with a line on the main scale. This indicates the fraction or decimal part of the measurement. Measurement Reading Technique For Vernier Caliper In order to read the measurement readings from vernier caliper properly, you need to remember two things before we start. For example, if a vernier caliper output a measurement reading of 2.13 cm , this means that: The main scale contributes the main number(s) and one decimal place to the reading (E.g. 2.1 cm, whereby 2 is the main number and 0.1 is the one decimal place number) The vernier scale contributes the second decimal place to the reading (E.g. 0.03 cm) Let’s examine the image of the vernier caliper readings above. We will just use a two steps method to get the measurement reading from this: To obtain the main scale reading: Look at the image above, 2.1 cm is to the immediate left of the zero on the vernier scale. Hence, the main scale reading is 2.1 cm To obtain the vernier scale reading: Look at the image above and look closely for an alignment of the scale lines of the main scale and vernier scale. In the image above, the aligned line correspond to 3. Hence, the vernier scale reading is 0.03 cm. In order to obtain the final measurement reading , we will add the main scale reading and vernier scale reading together. This will give 2.1 cm + 0.03 cm = 2.13 cm. In A Nutshell Use the following formula: Let’s go through another example to ensure that you understand the above steps: Main scale reading: 10.0 cm (Immediate left of zero) Vernier scale reading: 0.02 cm (Alignment of scale lines) Measurement reading : 10.02 cm Compensating For Zero Error It’s crucial to account for any zero error, which can be either negative or positive, based on the Vernier scale’s zero point relative position to the main scale’s zero. Correct readings are found by adjusting the observed measurement for this zero error. In A Nutshell Use the following formula: where can be either negative (the “0” of vernier scale is left of the “0” of the main scale) or positive (the “0” of vernier scale is right of the “0” of the main scale) OR Memorize this: Negative Zero Error: Indicates the Vernier zero is left of the main scale zero, requiring an addition to the reading. Positive Zero Error: Indicates the Vernier zero is right of the main scale zero, necessitating a subtraction from the reading. Explanation On Zero Error Formula Now, we shall try with zero error. If you are not familiar on how to handle zero error for vernier calipers, I suggest that you read up on Measurement of Length . The reading on the top is the measurement obtained and the reading at the bottom is the zero error. Find the actual measurement. (Meaning: get rid of the zero error in the measurement or take into account the zero error) Measurement with zero error: 3.34 cm Zero error: (negative because the vernier scale is to the left) Measurement without zero error: cm If you do not understand the subtraction of the negative zero error from the measurement, please read on. Since the zero error is , this means that all measurements taken by the vernier calipers will be SMALLER by 0.04cm. Hence, you will have to ADD 0.04 cm to ALL measurements in order to get the TRUE measurement. The subtraction is done in the above case is to have an elegant way of obtaining a resultant addition: and to make it COMPATIBLE with positive zero error. This means that once you have determined the nature of the zero error (positive or negative), you can just subtract the zero error and be sure that your final answer is correct. Consider a zero error of +0.04 cm. With my method, cm. Normal method: Since the zero error is +0.04 cm, this means that all measurements taken by the vernier calipers will be larger by 0.04 cm. Hence, you will have to SUBTRACT 0.04 cm from ALL measurements in order to get the true measurement. The final calculation will be cm, which is the same as my method.

Common Mistakes When Reading Vernier Caliper Measurements Despite the simplicity of reading a Vernier caliper, common mistakes can occur. Here are some potential errors and troubleshooting tips: Misalignment: Mistake: Incorrectly aligning the zero (0) point of the Vernier scale with the main scale. Troubleshooting: Double-check the alignment before recording measurements. Ensure the zero point aligns precisely with the main scale. Parallax Error: Mistake: Reading the measurement from an angle, causing a parallax error. Troubleshooting: View the Vernier scale and main scale directly from above to avoid parallax errors. Ensure your line of sight is perpendicular to the caliper. Decimal Point Misinterpretation: Mistake: Misinterpreting the decimal point on the Vernier scale, leading to errors in the recorded measurement. Troubleshooting: Pay close attention to the position of the decimal point on the Vernier scale. Be mindful of whether it aligns with a main scale division or falls in between two divisions. Vernier Scale Orientation: Mistake: Reading the Vernier scale upside down or in the wrong orientation. Troubleshooting: Always check that the Vernier scale is positioned correctly. The scale should slide parallel to the main scale, and the numbers and divisions should be easily readable. Jaw Misalignment: Mistake: The jaws of the Vernier caliper are not properly aligned when measuring, leading to inaccurate results. Troubleshooting: Ensure that the jaws of the caliper are clean and properly aligned. Any misalignment can affect the accuracy of the measurement. If misalignment persists, the caliper may require adjustment or repair. Neglecting Zero Error: Mistake: Neglecting to account for zero errors in the calibration of the Vernier caliper. Troubleshooting: Regularly check for zero errors by closing the jaws without any object in between. The zero on the Vernier scale should align precisely with the zero on the main scale. If there is a deviation, note the zero error and adjust future measurements accordingly. More Vernier Caliper Practice: Without Zero Error Finding The Zero Error With Zero Error With Other Measurement Topics Worked Examples Example 1 Where on the vernier calipers would you read to obtain the main scale reading? Show/Hide Answer The main scale reading is obtained from the reading on the main scale that is at the immediate left of the zero on the vernier scale. Example 2 Where on the vernier calipers would you read to obtain the vernier scale reading? Show/Hide Answer The vernier scale reading is obtained from the reading on the main scale that has an alignment of the scale lines of the main scale and vernier scale. Example 3 What is the smallest possible reading (in cm) of a vernier caliper? Show/Hide Answer The smallest possible reading of a vernier caliper is 0.01 cm. Example 4: Basic Measurement Reading You’re measuring the diameter of a small steel ball using a vernier caliper. The main scale reading just before the zero of the Vernier scale is 1.2 cm. The 6th line on the Vernier scale aligns perfectly with a line on the main scale. Calculate the diameter of the steel ball. Show/Hide Answer Main Scale Reading = 1.2 cm Vernier Scale Reading = 0.06 cm (Each line on the Vernier scale represents 0.01 cm, so the 6th line indicates an additional 0.06 cm.) Total Measurement = Main Scale Reading + Vernier Scale Reading = 1.2 cm + 0.06 cm = 1.26 cm The diameter of the steel ball is 1.26 cm. Example 5: Identifying Zero Error Upon closing the jaws of the vernier caliper without any object between them, you notice the zero mark of the Vernier scale is to the right of the main scale’s zero by 0.02 cm. When measuring a wire thickness, the main scale reads 0.5 cm, and the 8th line on the Vernier scale aligns with the main scale. What is the correct thickness of the wire? Show/Hide Answer Observed Main Scale Reading = 0.5 cm Vernier Scale Reading = 0.08 cm Observed Total Measurement = 0.5 cm + 0.08 cm = 0.58 cm Zero Error = +0.02 cm (Positive because the Vernier zero is right of the main scale zero.) Correct Measurement = Observed Measurement – Zero Error = 0.58 cm – 0.02 cm = 0.56 cm The correct thickness of the wire is 0.56 cm. Example 6: Advanced Measurement with Negative Zero Error Before measuring an object, you notice that the zero on the Vernier scale is slightly to the left of the main scale’s zero by 0.03 cm (negative zero error). The object’s measurement shows a main scale reading of 2.5 cm and the 10th line on the Vernier scale aligns with the main scale. What is the object’s actual size? Show/Hide Answer Main Scale Reading = 2.5 cm Vernier Scale Reading = 0.1 cm Observed Total Measurement = 2.5 cm + 0.1 cm = 2.6 cm Zero Error = -0.03 cm (Negative because the Vernier zero is left of the main scale zero.) Correct Measurement = Observed Measurement – Zero Error = 2.6 cm – (-0.03 cm) = 2.63 cm The actual size of the object is 2.63 cm. Example 7: Complex Scenario with Positive Zero Error You are measuring the length of a pencil using a vernier caliper and observe a positive zero error of 0.01 cm. The main scale reading is exactly at 7.5 cm, and the 15th line on the Vernier scale matches up with the main scale. Calculate the pencil’s accurate length. Show/Hide Answer Main Scale Reading = 7.5 cm Vernier Scale Reading = 0.15 cm (since each division is 0.01 cm) Observed Total Measurement = 7.5 cm + 0.15 cm = 7.65 cm Zero Error = +0.01 cm Correct Measurement = Observed Measurement – Zero Error = 7.65 cm – 0.01 cm = 7.64 cm The accurate length of the pencil is 7.64 cm. Example 8: Measuring with Misalignment Consideration During a measurement, you fail to notice a slight misalignment, resulting in a zero error of -0.04 cm. The main scale reading before the zero of the Vernier scale reads 3.0 cm, and the 12th line on the Vernier scale is aligned with the main scale. Correct the measurement considering the misalignment. Show/Hide Answer Main Scale Reading = 3.0 cm Vernier Scale Reading = 0.12 cm Observed Total Measurement = 3.0 cm + 0.12 cm = 3.12 cm Zero Error = -0.04 cm (Negative because of misalignment to the left.) Correct Measurement = Observed Measurement – Zero Error = 3.12 cm – (-0.04 cm) = 3.16 cm The correct measurement, taking into account the misalignment, is 3.16 cm.

Otherwise, the Vernier scale reading would be wrong if you use this technique. Am I right? Reply In the teaching of how to read a vernier caliper (metric). the section titled ‘Explanation of Zero error formula’ how is the 0.04 cm derived from the lower image? on my computer monitor the 4 of the vernier scale is not aligned with any value on the main scale; the 4 of the vernier scale is the only division positioned to the right of any of the main scale divisions- does this make it the error? Reply The value “6” on the vernier scale is aligned. Considering that the vernier scale is to the left, the zero error is -0.04cm. If you do not understand why i used “4” instead of “6”, look at the vernier scale again. As the value “6” is aligned, all measurements taken by the vernier caliper is SMALLER by 0.04 cm. Hence, zero error is -0.04 cm. Reply It’s very helpful But how did you get the second significant figure in the main scale of a vernier caliper reading I. E 3.4 Reply Yes, that explanation did not help me at all, but studying the images for a minute I figured it out. So, normally when you use the vernier scale, you’re adding an amount to the indicated value. The item being measured is larger than the main mark on the scale, so we count the vernier marks from left to right and add the amount to the main scale. In this case, we’re measuring something that is smaller than the first mark on the scale, so we really want to measure from right to left on the vernier scale. If you count from the right side of the vernier scale, you will get 4 because it’s 4 lines from the far right (10). Or you can just subtract the indicated vernier value from 10. So using the same example, 6-10 = -4. Or it may be intuitive to think of the main scale continuing to the left. In that case, the next mark below zero would be -0.1. you’re counting up from the mark like normal Reply Er, meant to erase that last paragraph. Ignore that; I changed my mind about using that explanation. I originally thought the same as you. This isn’t explained very well, however the reasoning is that the reading is 4 is because the zero of the vernier scale is to the left, we need to count back from the “10” mark on the vernier scale. In this case the 10 becomes 0, 9 =1, 8 =2 , 7=3, 6=4. Mathematically it should probably be described as 10-6=4, since that is the way the vernier scale lines are labelled.

Their measurements are presented in centimeters (cm) and are precise to two decimal places, for example, 1.23 cm. This guide will cover the essential aspects of reading measurements from a vernier caliper, applicable to models that use inches as well. Main Scale: The main scale is a fixed scale on the caliper and is typically graduated in millimeters or inches, depending on the unit of measurement. Each division on the main scale represents a specific measurement unit, and it provides the whole number part of the measurement. Vernier Scale: The Vernier scale is a secondary scale that slides parallel to the main scale. It has a series of divisions that are slightly smaller than those on the main scale. The zero (0) point on the Vernier scale corresponds to a specific point on the main scale, ensuring alignment during measurements. Alignment: To read the Vernier scale, align the zero (0) point of the Vernier scale with the closest point on the main scale. Look for the first line on the Vernier scale that aligns perfectly with a line on the main scale. This indicates the fraction or decimal part of the measurement. Measurement Reading Technique For Vernier Caliper In order to read the measurement readings from vernier caliper properly, you need to remember two things before we start. For example, if a vernier caliper output a measurement reading of 2.13 cm , this means that: The main scale contributes the main number(s) and one decimal place to the reading (E.g. 2.1 cm, whereby 2 is the main number and 0.1 is the one decimal place number) The vernier scale contributes the second decimal place to the reading (E.g. 0.03 cm) Let’s examine the image of the vernier caliper readings above.

    "html": "December 1706: Birth of Émilie du Châtelet | American Physical Society APS News | This Month in Physics History December 1706: Birth of Émilie du Châtelet Famous for being Voltaire’s mistress, Émilie du Châtelet was actually a talented scientist and intellectual in her own right. Dec. 1, 2008 Émilie du Châtelet Wikipedia/Maurice Quentin de La Tou Émilie du Châtelet, famous for being Voltaire’s mistress, was actually a talented scientist and intellectual in her own right. Overcoming challenges that kept women from becoming scientists at the time, she educated herself and carried out experiments in physics, and completed a translation and commentary on Newton’s Principia . Gabrielle Émilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil (later Émilie du Châtelet), was born December 17, 1706 in Paris. Her father, Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil, was a high ranking official of the court of Louis XIV. The de Breteuil family was part of French aristocratic society, and as such they entertained often. Distinguished scientists and mathematicians were frequent visitors to the household. Educated at home, the young Émilie learned to speak six languages by the time she was twelve, and had lessons in fencing and other sports. Even from a young age she was fascinated most by science and math, much to her mother’s displeasure. Such interests were not viewed as proper for young ladies, and her mother even threatened to send her away to a convent. Fortunately, her father recognized her intelligence and encouraged her interests, arranging for her to discuss astronomy with prominent scientists he knew. Émilie also had a flair for gambling, applying her talent at mathematics to give herself an advantage. She used her winnings to buy books and laboratory equipment for her scientific investigations. When she reached age 18, she knew she had to get married, and she accepted the proposal of Marquis Florent-Claude du Châtelet, a distinguished army officer. This was a convenient arrangement for Émilie, because Châtelet was often away from home, leaving her free to indulge her interests in studying math and science on her own. She was also free to carry on an affair with the writer Voltaire, one of the few men who appreciated her intelligence and encouraged her scientific pursuits. Émilie du Châtelet and Voltaire renovated Châtelet’s large estate house in the countryside. The house included several rooms for scientific equipment and space for experiments, and a large library holding over 20,000 books, more than many universities at the time. Although she was frustrated at being excluded from scientific society and education because she was a woman, she was able to learn mathematics and science from several renowned scholars, including Pierre-Louis Maupertuis and Samuel Konig, by inviting them to her house. In 1737, after several months of conducting research in secret, she entered a contest sponsored by the French Academy of Sciences on the nature of light, heat and fire, submitting her paper Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu . In it she suggested that different colors of light carried different heating power and anticipated the existence of what is now known as infrared radiation. She did not win the contest, but her paper was published and was positively received by the scientific community. She also developed a strong interest in the work of Isaac Newton, which was somewhat controversial at the time in France, where Cartesian philosophy was favored over Newton’s ideas. Émilie and Voltaire jointly wrote a book, Elements of Newton’s Philosophy , which explained Newton’s astronomy and optics in a clear manner for a wide French readership. Only Voltaire’s name appeared on the book, but he acknowledged her important role. Émilie also worked on another manuscript, Foundations of Physics , in which she considered the philosophical basis of science and tried to integrate the conflicting Newtonian, Cartesian, and Leibnizian views. One of her most important contributions to science was her elucidation of the concepts of energy and energy conservation. Following experiments done earlier by Willem ‘s Gravesande, she dropped heavy lead balls into a bed of clay. She showed that the balls that hit the clay with twice the velocity penetrated four times as deep into the clay; those with three times the velocity reached a depth nine times greater. This suggested that energy is proportional to mv2, not mv, as Newton had suggested. While conducting her scientific work, Émilie du Châtelet still carried out her duties as a mother to her three children and as a hostess for her many visitors so she was always busy, and had little time for sleep. At age 42 Émilie du Châtelet discovered she was pregnant. At that time, a pregnancy at such an old age was extremely dangerous. Knowing she would likely die, she began working 18 hours a day to complete her biggest project, a French translation of Newton’s Principia , before she died. More than simply a translation, Émilie du Châtelet’s Principia included her own notes, examples, derivations, and clarifications of Newton’s often obscure writing, as well as examples of experiments that confirmed Newton’s theories. Her modern notation and clear style soon helped French scientists understand and build upon Newton’s ideas. With determined effort, she achieved her goal of finishing the manuscript just before she died in September 1749. The complete work was published ten years later, when the return of Halley’s Comet brought about a renewed interest in Newtonian mechanics. Émilie du Châtelet’s book was for many years the only available translation of Newton’s Principia into French, and the translation and insightful commentary probably helped advance science in France. Nonetheless, Émilie du Châtelet herself was largely forgotten by history (or remembered mainly as Voltaire’s mistress) and only recently have her scientific achievements been brought to light.

Émilie du Châtelet’s book was for many years the only available translation of Newton’s Principia into French, and the translation and insightful commentary probably helped advance science in France. Nonetheless, Émilie du Châtelet herself was largely forgotten by history (or remembered mainly as Voltaire’s mistress) and only recently have her scientific achievements been brought to light.

It is characterized by its banded or layered \nappearance, with alternating colors and patterns. These bands are often \ncurved or concentric, creating unique and visually striking designs. \nAgate forms in cavities within volcanic or sedimentary rocks, where \nsilica-rich fluids deposit layers of quartz over time. Agate can be found in a wide range of colors, including blue, \ngreen, red, yellow, and white. Agate forms when silica-rich fluids fill cavities in rocks (such as gas bubbles in volcanic lava). Over time, the silica precipitates out of the fluid, forming layers of microcrystalline quartz. The banding is caused by variations in the composition or impurities in the silica-rich solutions. Cryptocrystalline means that the mineral crystals are so fine that they are only vaguely seen in patterns and fine variations. The name is derived from its occurrence at the Achates River in southwestern Sicily. A distinctly banded fibrous chalcedony. Originally reported from Dirillo river (Achates river), Acate, Ragusa Province, Sicily, Italy. Types of Agate. Where to Find Agate Most agates occur as nodules in volcanic rocks or ancient lavas, in former cavities produced by volatiles in the original molten mass, which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses. Such agates, when cut transversely, exhibit a succession of parallel lines, often of extreme tenuity, giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as banded agate, riband agate and striped agate. Many agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of drusy quartz, sometimes amethystine, having the apices of the crystals directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity or geode. Note: Agate is not simply \"banded chalcedony.\" There are other types of chalcedony that are banded that do not match the description above, banded flint, for example. Agate Types and Varieties It's unlikely we'll ever have a complete list of all the names for Agate, since there are already hundreds of old ones and new ones are being made up all the time, often without any input from the scientists who actually study and classify the rocks. Some variety names are used by collectors and dealers, but there are tons more invented by dealers to describe a specific location or other characteristics. The varieties listed below are the ones you're most likely to come across. There are various types of agate, including Moss Agate, Fire Agate, \nBlue Lace Agate, Crazy Lace Agate, Dendritic Agate, Botswana Agate, \nLaguna Agate, Turritella Agate, Eye Agate, Condor Agate, Enhydro Agate, \nand Iris Agate. There\n are a number of varieties of chalcedony that are called \"agate\" that \ndo not match the definition given above. Good examples are \" feather agates \" and \" fire agates \". These are listed as varieties of chalcedony, not as varieties of agate. Onyx Agate Onyx-Agate from Minas Geraís, Brazil. Collection:Technical University Kosice. Photography by Ivan Karas Onyx is formed of bands of chalcedony in alternating colors. It is cryptocrystalline, consisting of fine intergrowths of the silica minerals quartz and moganite. Its bands are parallel to one another, as opposed to the more chaotic banding that often occurs in agates. The colors of its bands range from white to almost every color (save some shades, such as purple or blue). Commonly, specimens of onyx contain bands of black and/or white. Sardonyx is a variant in which the colored bands are sard (shades of red) rather than black. Read more about Onyx here Iris Agate Iris Agate in the sun, Wood's Stoneworks and Photo Factory on flickr Iris Agate is a mesmerizing variety of agate known for its captivating display of rainbow colors when illuminated from behind. It's a finely banded agate, meaning it has thin layers of different colored chalcedony. When cut into thin slices and backlit, these layers diffract light, creating a stunning iridescent effect similar to a rainbow. t is named after the Greek word \"iris,\" which means \"rainbow\" or \"rainbow-like appearance,\" aptly reflecting its characteristic feature. In its natural state, iris agate may appear like any other ordinary agate, with a solid or banded color. However, its magic unfolds when sliced into thin sections and illuminated from behind. This process reveals a mesmerizing play of colors, showcasing the entire spectrum of the rainbow. Iris agate is found in various locations worldwide, including Brazil, Madagascar, and the United States. Crazy Lace Agate Crazy Lace Agate From Chihuahua, Mun. Mexico Credit: Anton Crazy Lace Agate is a variety of banded Chalcedony, It is predominantly white, with layers of creamy browns, blacks and grays. Some may include layers of yellow ochre, gold, scarlet and red. Agate is sometimes called the earth rainbow because, in its various forms, the concentric bands in nature form nearly every color the earth can produce, including a colorless form. Thunder-egg Agate Thunder egg is a nodule-like rock, similar to a filled geode, that is formed within volcanic ash layers Thunder-egg is a nodule-like rock, similar to a filled geode, that is formed within rhyolitic volcanic ash layers. Thundereggs are rough spheres, most about the size of a baseball- though they can range from less than an inch to over a meter across. They usually contain centres of chalcedony which may have been fractured followed by deposition of agate, jasper or opal, either uniquely or in combination. Also frequently encountered are quartz and gypsum crystals, as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions. Enhydro Agate Translucency of the Brazilian enhydro agate. Credit: The Agatelady Enhydro agate are nodules, agates, or geodes with water trapped inside its cavity. Enhydros are closely related to fluid inclusions, but are composed of chalcedony. The formation of enhydros is still an ongoing process, with specimens dated back to the Eocene Epoch. They are commonly found in areas with volcanic rock. Polyhedroid Agate Polyhedroid agate from Pariaba, Brazil. Polyhedroid agate is agate which has grown in a flat-sided shape similar to a polyhedron. When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric polygons. Polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in Paraíba State, Brazil. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved. Moss Agate A piece of colorful moss agate stone from Indonesia. Credit: Yudi Aswanto Moss agate is a semi-precious gemstone formed from silicon dioxide. It is a form of chalcedony which includes minerals of a green colour embedded in the stone, forming filaments and other patterns suggestive of moss. The field is a clear or milky-white quartz, and the included minerals are mainly oxides of manganese or iron. It is not a true form of agate, as it lacks agate's defining feature of concentric banding. Moss agate is of the white variety with green inclusions that resemble moss. It occurs in many locations. The colors are formed due to trace amounts of metal present as an impurity, such as chrome or iron. The metals can make different colors depending on their valence (oxidation state). Despite its name, moss agate does not contain organic matter and is usually formed from weathered volcanic rocks. Lake Superior Agate Agate Lake Superior Photo Copyright © Lech Darski The Lake Superior agate is a type of agate stained by iron and found on the shores of Lake Superior. Its wide distribution and iron-rich bands of color reflect the gemstone's geologic history in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Lake Superior agate was selected because the agate reflects many aspects of Minnesota. It was formed during lava eruptions that occurred in Minnesota about a billion years ago. The stone's predominant red color comes from iron, a major Minnesota industrial mineral found extensively throughout the Iron Range region. Finally, the Lake Superior agate can be found in many regions of Minnesota as it was distributed by glacial movement across Minnesota 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Condor Agate Condor agate from Argentina Condor Agate is primarily found in the mountains of northern Argentina, near the Rio Condor, which is where it gets its name. Condor Agate often exhibits a range of colors, including reds, oranges, yellows, blues, purples, and greens, creating vibrant and eye-catching patterns within the stone. Condor agate was discovered and named by Luis de los Santos in 1993. One of the distinctive features of Condor Agate is its intricate banding, which can resemble landscapes, abstract art, or even scenes from nature. Sagenite Agate Sagenite Agate Sagenite Agate is an agate with acicular or or pointed inclusions of various minerals (mostly rutile). These hair like formations are often arranged in fans or bursts. The crystals are arranged in a fan-like or sunburst pattern, which gives the stone its distinctive appearance. Sagenite agate is found in many parts of the world, including Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. It is a popular gemstone for jewelry and other decorative items. Fortification Agate Fortification Agate, Amethyst Cove. Photo Credit: Christopher Sheppard Fortification agate is a type of agate that is characterized by its distinctive banding pattern. The bands are typically sharp-angled and often resemble the outlines of fortifications, such as a castle or a fort. Fortification agates can be found in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black. They are typically found in sedimentary rock formations, such as sandstone and limestone. Fortification agates are prized for their beauty and rarity. They are often used in jewelry and other decorative items. Some fortification agates are also considered to be good luck charms. Fairburn Agate Fairburn agates  Locality: Rapid City, South Dakota, United States Photo: © Captain Tenneal Fairburn Agate is a unique and rare variety of Fortification Agate from Fairburn, Custer Co., South Dakota, USA. The state gem of South Dakota. Formed in Pennsylvanian-Permian carbonate sediments and weathered out since Oligocene around the Black Hills. Agates in Nebraska formed in Pennsylvanian sediments and were transported from the Hartville uplift in Wyoming in the Oligocene. Fairburn agates are composed of concentric layers of cryptocrystalline chalcedony colorized by different trace minerals. However, fortification banding distinguishes fairburns from other agate types. Fortification banding means that the concentric layers have sharp changes in direction which cause the bands to form angles in ways which are especially distinguishable from other agate types. Mainly, no other agate type forms these patterns. Fairburn agates are typically found in a variety of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. They can also be found in a variety of patterns, including fortification banding, dendritic banding, and mottled banding. Botswana Agate A Slab of Agate From Botswana. Photo by Avegaon on Flickr Botswana Agate is a type of banded agate that is found exclusively in Botswana, a country located in southern Africa. It is known for its intricate banding patterns, which are a result of the stone forming in layers of volcanic ash. Botswana Agate is typically found in shades of white, black, gray, and blue, but it can also be found in other colors, such as red and pink. Dendritic Agate Dendritic Agate from India Photo: LlunaLluviaGems Dendritic agate is a popular gemstone and is used in jewelry. It is characterized by its tree-like or fern-like patterns, which are \ncaused by the presence of manganese or iron oxide minerals. Dendritic agate is formed when silica-rich groundwater flows through cracks and fissures in rocks. The silica slowly precipitates out of the water and forms a dendritic pattern. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the oxidation of iron or manganese minerals. Coyamito Agate Coyamito Agate Coyamito Agate is a specific type of agate that comes from the Coyamito Ranch area in Chihuahua, Mexico. Known for its high occurrence of pseudomorphs. Pseudomorphs are fascinating minerals that form when one mineral replaces another, preserving the original mineral's shape but not its composition. In Coyamito Agate, quartz replaces other minerals like calcite or dolomite, creating unique textures and patterns. Due to the pseudomorphs, Coyamito Agate can exhibit a wide variety of colors and textures. They can be solid-colored, banded, or even have brecciated (fragmented) appearances. Some may even show remnants of the original replaced mineral's structure. Plume Agate Natural Plume agate Plume agate is a type of agate that is characterized by its featherlike inclusions. These inclusions can be a variety of colors, including white, gray, black, and brown. Plume agate is a relatively rare type of agate, and it is often more expensive than other types of agate. Plume agate is formed when iron oxides are deposited in agate in a way that resembles feathers or smoke. The iron oxides can be deposited in a variety of ways, including through volcanic activity, hydrothermal activity, and weathering. It is a rarer type of agate and is often more expensive than other types of agate. Red Fox Agate Red Fox Agate Red Fox Agate is a rare and beautiful variety characterized by its vibrant orange, red, and white bands, reminiscent of a red fox's fur. These distinctive bands are often accompanied by botryoidal hematite inclusions, which give the stone a distinctive \"foxy\" appearance. Red Fox Agate is primarily found in alluvial deposits (loose sediments transported by water) in the Patagonia region of Argentina. Laguna Agate Laguna Agate - Chihuahua, Mexico Laguna Agate is a highly sought-after variety of agate known for its vibrant red and scarlet hues with occasional shades of deep red, milky white, yellow, gold, and brown. It is considered the most highly prized banded agate in the world due to its extremely tight banding and intense colors. Found in a remote mountainous region in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Tube Agate Tube agate, By: LSAgates Tube agate is characterized by hollow, tube-shaped inclusions within the stone. These inclusions come in various colors and often contrast beautifully against a translucent chalcedony background. Its formation involves silica-rich fluids dissolving pre-existing minerals, leaving cavities. Later, these cavities fill with chalcedony, creating the signature tube-like structures through a process called pseudomorphic replacement. Tube agate can be found in various locations worldwide, with notable sources in Mexico, Turkey and Brazil. The way a tube \nagate is cut significantly impacts the visible patterns. Cutting parallel to the length of the tubes reveals elongated, finger-like formations within the stone. Conversely, cutting perpendicular creates a captivating eye or orbicular pattern, showcasing concentric circles. Conclusion, These names are often used to describe the appearance and origin of the agate. The diversity in colors and patterns makes agate a popular choice for jewelry and decorative items. Keep in mind that there are many local and regional names for specific types of agate, and the classification can vary among different sources.

    "html": "Owl Legs: All You Need To Know Search Search Search Menu Menu Search Search Search Menu Owl Legs: All You Need To Know 2 comments Share: Facebook X Pinterest Menu Owl Legs: All You Need To Know by Tristan Silver 12.04.2023 Who doesn’t love owls? Owls are some of the most recognizable, adorable-looking creatures (especially the tiny ones!). They have a distinct shape, often prominent ear tufts, large eyes, and impressive talons at the end of their toes. Their hunting techniques are highly efficient, their vision is exceptional, and their unique adaptations suit them for their nighttime forays. Owls comprise around 200 species worldwide, from the smallest species, the Elf Owl , to the largest species – like the enormous-looking Great Grey Owl . Each owl species is unique, with various colors, plumage patterns, and body shapes. The species are divided into two families, Tytonidae and Strigidae . They’re all ferocious predators who don’t blink an eye when the opportunity to catch a rodent or other small prey item is available. The prey items owls favor differ between the species and geographic areas. Still, they generally eat small mammals (predominantly small rodents), birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects (particularly moths), and sometimes even fish. Owls catch and kill their prey using their long legs and talons. Based on how you usually see owls, it may be difficult to believe, but their legs are often very long and pale yellow or grey. If you’ve seen photos of owl legs without the dense feathery covering, you’ll know just how long their legs can be. If you’d like to find out more about owl legs, read on to learn more! Owl Leg Structure Owl legs have a fascinating design, which is similar to most birds. They have a very short thigh bone (femur) and long shin bones. When you see owl legs, the main joint you’re likely to see is often mistaken as being the knee, but it is, in fact, the ankle, as birds have very long feet. Therefore, it may not seem like owls have knees because they are found near the top of their legs. They are very close to their bodies and covered in feathers. Owls have feet containing four toes. On the end of each toe is a claw (also known as a talon). The toes are arranged uniquely – different from most other birds. The two toes on the edges (first and fourth toes) point backward, while the two middle toes (second and third toes) point forwards. That arrangement makes their feet zygodactyl, and it enables owls to pick up prey and perch effectively. Owl claws, like those on diurnal raptors, are incredibly sharp. The zygodactyl arrangement and the sharpness enable owls to grip prey from opposite sides, preventing the prey from escaping and, in the end, making the kill. The zygodactyl arrangement also allows the owl to hold steadily onto branches and other perches with their toes. The ankle joint is crucial as it allows the owl to rotate its toes and catch prey from all angles. The high knee placement is also vital, enabling owls to be more flexible and have more leg movement, which aids hunting and, therefore, survival. On owl legs, a joint connects the thigh to the body and is located further forward on an owl’s body than on many other types of birds. This adaptation allows them to rotate their legs further forward and perch without losing balance and falling off. You don’t typically see owl legs because feathers cover them. The feathers function in providing insulation and keeping the owls warm at night. There are some owl species with feathered feet. That adaption allows them to tiptoe on the ground, sneaking up on prey items and pouncing without needing to fly. Owls’ legs are well protected from any of the prey items that try to bite them by their hard, scaled skin. How Many Legs Do Owls Have? Owls have two legs, which are located underneath their bodies. Owl legs are thin, feathered, and lightweight. Those features allow them to move efficiently and quietly, whether in flight or while walking on the ground. How Long Are Owl Legs? As you know by now, owls have very long legs. So long, in fact, that they can be almost half as long as their bodies. The deviation is quite significant, and the length of owl legs varies by species. Small owls have much shorter legs than large owls. The ratio of owl leg length to body size varies dramatically between species, with some species having short legs compared to their bodies and others having longer legs. Other than the fact that smaller owls typically have shorter legs, some of the main reasons behind an owl’s leg length are their environment and hunting methods . Owls live in different environments, from open habitats like fields and tundra to forests. The birds living in each environment require different-sized lengths for many reasons. Owls that hunt in fields , grasslands , and other open area s have longer legs because they need to capture prey in tall grass or walk on the ground. Long legs would be a disadvantage in forests as they would get in the way of maneuverability. Therefore, birds that hunt in forests have shorter legs. The short legs mean they can fly and move easily around trees and other vegetation. The shortest owl legs are as short as 4 inches ( 10 centimeters), while the longest owl legs are up to 15 inches ( 38 centimeters) in length. Which Species Has The Longest Legs? The record of the longest owl legs belongs to the Eurasian Eagle-owl , whose legs measure in at a whopping 15 inches ( 38 centimeters) long. Why Are Owl Legs Long? As you know from seeing photos on the internet, owl legs are long and thin. They’re usually disproportionately thin compared to the rest of the body and can look delicate. However, owls have powerful, thick legs with essential functions in their day-to-day (or night-to-night , shall we say?) lives. Owls need to have significantly strong legs as they are mainly used for hunting animals at night. Their legs must be strong enough to capture the prey, pin it down to the ground, and prevent it from escaping. Apart from hunting, owl legs are long and thin because they are required for flight, warmth, and maneuvering in the environment. Hunting Owls are formidable hunters equipped with adaptations that make them perfect for catching creatures in the depths of the night. They usually hunt from a perch, observing their surroundings for anything that moves. Once an animal has been seen, they swoop down. They fly efficiently and silently through the air. Once within striking distance, they pounce on the unknowing creature by grabbing it with their talons. Their sharp talons grip the animal tightly and kill it by causing stab wounds or constriction. Owls also have strong, sharp beaks that they sometimes use to crush the prey item if the talons haven’t done the job. The ferocity of owl talons doesn’t end there. They have potent feet and can grip their prey while exerting a force of approximately 500 pounds per square inch. It would be difficult for any creature to survive the sharp talons and the substantial force delivered. They can pick up prey that weighs far more than they do due to the strength of their legs. One of the most critical evolutionary advantages of using feet and talons to capture and kill prey is protecting the predator’s head from harm. Owls rely heavily on their eyes to find prey, so using their talons to kill them mitigates the chances of injuring those critical organs. Flight As discussed previously, Owls have short thighs and long shins. There is a reason why owls have long, thin legs with short thighs, and that is flight. To fly successfully, birds must keep their weight in the middle of their bodies to ensure a balanced distribution. That prevents them from falling over and keeps them steady while flying. The strength in owl legs comes mainly from the thighs, which contain large muscles. Large muscles carry a lot of weight, so owls have short thighs that are very close to their bodies. It keeps the weight distribution near the center and evenly distributed. If the thighs were more extended, there would be a wider weight distribution, and the legs’ weight would prevent them from flying efficiently. Their legs are long and thin from the knees to their toes, making them light enough to have minimal impact on weight and flight. Warmth Many owls live in frigid, cold environments. Their leg structure allows them to survive in cold conditions. As with humans, their external limbs are usually colder than body parts considered more important, like their chests. Owl legs are made from bones and connected by tendons, so they can become freezing without affecting the owls detrimentally. Therefore, they can let their feet and legs get far colder than the rest of their bodies which hold organs and muscles needed for survival, without losing bodily functions. Some owls, like the Snowy Owl that lives in frigid conditions, also have dense feathers on their bellies to help hold onto body warmth in addition to the leg feathers. The Great Grey Owl has so much layering on the body that you may only see its claws and eyes exposed. It makes them appear to be larger than they are. Maneuverability When it comes to flying, owls do it exceptionally silently. They’ll fly right past you without you knowing they’re there if they don’t call. They have adaptions on their wings that allow them to cause no sound, but their long legs also aid in muffling the sound. The long legs absorb the shock of landing in trees and on the ground, causing noise reduction and the sound of landing to dissipate. 5 Interesting Facts About Owls 1. Owls Hunt With Their Legs Owls are carnivorous creatures that catch and eat prey by hunting them at night. Owls typically hunt in open areas where they can easily find prey and where perches like trees are found. They usually perch on a tree and look for prey items on the ground. Once they see an animal they’d like to eat, they swoop in silence, extend their legs, open their toes and talons, and grab their prey. The sharp, strong talons kill the prey. The owl usually carries away the prey to a safe eating spot. 2. Their Shins Are Longer Than Their Thighs Owl legs have a strange look caused by their unique design, with really long shin bones and short thighs. 3. Owls Can Go Fishing Yes, you read that correctly. Owls hunt fish. You don’t see it frequently; only a few species do it. Some species, like the Pel’s Fishing Owl , are specialized to catch fish, as their name suggests. These owls regularly sit in large trees along rivers and fly down to catch the fish when they see one near the surface. They skim the water’s surface with their talons and grasp the fish when they hunt. 4. Owls Can Lock Their Toes Around Perches And Prey Another remarkable adaptation that owls have is their ability to perch on a branch, wrap their toes around it, and lock themselves in position. The reasoning is that, unlike human hands that relax when open, owl feet are relaxed when closed. Therefore, grasping onto a perch to sleep allows them to relax their muscles. 5. Owls Also Use Their Feet As Hands. Once an animal has been caught and the owl is in a safe place to eat, the owl uses its feet to hold the prey while it tears off pieces of flesh with its beak. This is usually done when the owl needs to feed its chicks. Owls that swallow their prey whole will use one of their feet to lift the prey item and move it toward its beak. Why Owls Have Fluffy Legs Unlike many other birds, owls have feathered legs that appear fluffy. Owls have feathered legs to keep themselves warm and help with thermoregulation. In the far northern, freezing areas, owls also have feathered feet, which help insulate their bodies even more. That is because the owls usually have to hunt in snow or on frozen ground when the temperatures are well below zero. For most owl species, the feathered legs allow them to stay warm at night while they hunt. Do Owls Walk? Owls can and certainly do walk. It’s just not something they frequently do, as flying from one place to another is more energy efficient. Their legs and feet also aren’t designed for walking. They are adapted to perching and flying rather than walking. Owls can climb trees with their talons, which can look like they’re walking up the side of a tree. They are more suited to this behavior as they use their sharp talons to grasp onto the tree, and their strong legs help them move up. An owl walking could be a bad sign because it can indicate that the owl is sick or injured , so they are unable to fly. Do Owls Run? Have you ever seen an owl walking? If you have, you’d be able to imagine how funny they’d look if they were to run. Luckily for those of you that find owls entertaining, owls can and do run and can be very amusing. However, owls rarely run. They are far more suited to flying, hopping, and perching, so they use those strategies to hunt and capture prey rather than running. The owl you’re most likely to see running is the Burrowing Owl . Burrowing Owls can pick up quite a speed and run pretty fast for a little owl. Burrowing Owls are often active during the day as they enjoy eating insects. So if you spend time at a Burrowing Owl burrow, you may see them chasing and catching insects and other prey items that they find on the ground. Conclusion In conclusion, owl legs may not constantly be visible (other than the feet), but they’re there, and they’re stronger than they look. Owl legs are extremely powerful, enabling them to take down a range of different creatures. Their legs are often very long compared to their bodies. There are a number of reasons for this, including hunting, flight, warmth, and maneuverability. Owl legs are also perceived to be longer than they actually are because of their skinniness. They are thin as it provides a balanced weight distribution, allowing them to fly efficiently. This feature is not limited to owls; however, it’s the reason why all birds have thin legs. It prevents the weight from being on the edges of their bodies. You may not be able to see owl legs properly because they have dense layers of feathers (leggings) that keep them covered for warmth and catching prey. The leggings are particularly beneficial to owls that live in freezing, harsh environments that need extra warmth.

Their legs have all the same parts as ours. You would have done a much better job explaining the structure with a diagram or photo of the whole leg from hip to talon.

Owls are some of the most recognizable, adorable-looking creatures (especially the tiny ones!). They have a distinct shape, often prominent ear tufts, large eyes, and impressive talons at the end of their toes. Their hunting techniques are highly efficient, their vision is exceptional, and their unique adaptations suit them for their nighttime forays. Owls comprise around 200 species worldwide, from the smallest species, the Elf Owl , to the largest species – like the enormous-looking Great Grey Owl . Each owl species is unique, with various colors, plumage patterns, and body shapes. The species are divided into two families, Tytonidae and Strigidae . They’re all ferocious predators who don’t blink an eye when the opportunity to catch a rodent or other small prey item is available. The prey items owls favor differ between the species and geographic areas. Still, they generally eat small mammals (predominantly small rodents), birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects (particularly moths), and sometimes even fish. Owls catch and kill their prey using their long legs and talons. Based on how you usually see owls, it may be difficult to believe, but their legs are often very long and pale yellow or grey. If you’ve seen photos of owl legs without the dense feathery covering, you’ll know just how long their legs can be. If you’d like to find out more about owl legs, read on to learn more! Owl Leg Structure Owl legs have a fascinating design, which is similar to most birds. They have a very short thigh bone (femur) and long shin bones. When you see owl legs, the main joint you’re likely to see is often mistaken as being the knee, but it is, in fact, the ankle, as birds have very long feet. Therefore, it may not seem like owls have knees because they are found near the top of their legs. They are very close to their bodies and covered in feathers. Owls have feet containing four toes. On the end of each toe is a claw (also known as a talon). The toes are arranged uniquely – different from most other birds. The two toes on the edges (first and fourth toes) point backward, while the two middle toes (second and third toes) point forwards. That arrangement makes their feet zygodactyl, and it enables owls to pick up prey and perch effectively. Owl claws, like those on diurnal raptors, are incredibly sharp. The zygodactyl arrangement and the sharpness enable owls to grip prey from opposite sides, preventing the prey from escaping and, in the end, making the kill. The zygodactyl arrangement also allows the owl to hold steadily onto branches and other perches with their toes. The ankle joint is crucial as it allows the owl to rotate its toes and catch prey from all angles. The high knee placement is also vital, enabling owls to be more flexible and have more leg movement, which aids hunting and, therefore, survival. On owl legs, a joint connects the thigh to the body and is located further forward on an owl’s body than on many other types of birds. This adaptation allows them to rotate their legs further forward and perch without losing balance and falling off. You don’t typically see owl legs because feathers cover them. The feathers function in providing insulation and keeping the owls warm at night. There are some owl species with feathered feet. That adaption allows them to tiptoe on the ground, sneaking up on prey items and pouncing without needing to fly. Owls’ legs are well protected from any of the prey items that try to bite them by their hard, scaled skin. How Many Legs Do Owls Have? Owls have two legs, which are located underneath their bodies. Owl legs are thin, feathered, and lightweight. Those features allow them to move efficiently and quietly, whether in flight or while walking on the ground. How Long Are Owl Legs? As you know by now, owls have very long legs. So long, in fact, that they can be almost half as long as their bodies. The deviation is quite significant, and the length of owl legs varies by species. Small owls have much shorter legs than large owls. The ratio of owl leg length to body size varies dramatically between species, with some species having short legs compared to their bodies and others having longer legs. Other than the fact that smaller owls typically have shorter legs, some of the main reasons behind an owl’s leg length are their environment and hunting methods . Owls live in different environments, from open habitats like fields and tundra to forests. The birds living in each environment require different-sized lengths for many reasons. Owls that hunt in fields , grasslands , and other open area s have longer legs because they need to capture prey in tall grass or walk on the ground. Long legs would be a disadvantage in forests as they would get in the way of maneuverability. Therefore, birds that hunt in forests have shorter legs. The short legs mean they can fly and move easily around trees and other vegetation. The shortest owl legs are as short as 4 inches ( 10 centimeters), while the longest owl legs are up to 15 inches ( 38 centimeters) in length. Which Species Has The Longest Legs? The record of the longest owl legs belongs to the Eurasian Eagle-owl , whose legs measure in at a whopping 15 inches ( 38 centimeters) long. Why Are Owl Legs Long? As you know from seeing photos on the internet, owl legs are long and thin. They’re usually disproportionately thin compared to the rest of the body and can look delicate. However, owls have powerful, thick legs with essential functions in their day-to-day (or night-to-night , shall we say?) lives. Owls need to have significantly strong legs as they are mainly used for hunting animals at night. Their legs must be strong enough to capture the prey, pin it down to the ground, and prevent it from escaping. Apart from hunting, owl legs are long and thin because they are required for flight, warmth, and maneuvering in the environment. Hunting Owls are formidable hunters equipped with adaptations that make them perfect for catching creatures in the depths of the night. They usually hunt from a perch, observing their surroundings for anything that moves. Once an animal has been seen, they swoop down. They fly efficiently and silently through the air. Once within striking distance, they pounce on the unknowing creature by grabbing it with their talons. Their sharp talons grip the animal tightly and kill it by causing stab wounds or constriction. Owls also have strong, sharp beaks that they sometimes use to crush the prey item if the talons haven’t done the job. The ferocity of owl talons doesn’t end there. They have potent feet and can grip their prey while exerting a force of approximately 500 pounds per square inch. It would be difficult for any creature to survive the sharp talons and the substantial force delivered. They can pick up prey that weighs far more than they do due to the strength of their legs. One of the most critical evolutionary advantages of using feet and talons to capture and kill prey is protecting the predator’s head from harm. Owls rely heavily on their eyes to find prey, so using their talons to kill them mitigates the chances of injuring those critical organs. Flight As discussed previously, Owls have short thighs and long shins. There is a reason why owls have long, thin legs with short thighs, and that is flight. To fly successfully, birds must keep their weight in the middle of their bodies to ensure a balanced distribution. That prevents them from falling over and keeps them steady while flying. The strength in owl legs comes mainly from the thighs, which contain large muscles. Large muscles carry a lot of weight, so owls have short thighs that are very close to their bodies. It keeps the weight distribution near the center and evenly distributed. If the thighs were more extended, there would be a wider weight distribution, and the legs’ weight would prevent them from flying efficiently. Their legs are long and thin from the knees to their toes, making them light enough to have minimal impact on weight and flight. Warmth Many owls live in frigid, cold environments. Their leg structure allows them to survive in cold conditions. As with humans, their external limbs are usually colder than body parts considered more important, like their chests. Owl legs are made from bones and connected by tendons, so they can become freezing without affecting the owls detrimentally. Therefore, they can let their feet and legs get far colder than the rest of their bodies which hold organs and muscles needed for survival, without losing bodily functions. Some owls, like the Snowy Owl that lives in frigid conditions, also have dense feathers on their bellies to help hold onto body warmth in addition to the leg feathers. The Great Grey Owl has so much layering on the body that you may only see its claws and eyes exposed. It makes them appear to be larger than they are. Maneuverability When it comes to flying, owls do it exceptionally silently. They’ll fly right past you without you knowing they’re there if they don’t call. They have adaptions on their wings that allow them to cause no sound, but their long legs also aid in muffling the sound. The long legs absorb the shock of landing in trees and on the ground, causing noise reduction and the sound of landing to dissipate. 5 Interesting Facts About Owls 1.

The reasoning is that, unlike human hands that relax when open, owl feet are relaxed when closed. Therefore, grasping onto a perch to sleep allows them to relax their muscles. 5. Owls Also Use Their Feet As Hands. Once an animal has been caught and the owl is in a safe place to eat, the owl uses its feet to hold the prey while it tears off pieces of flesh with its beak.

    "html": "PhysicsLAB: Famous Experiments: The Discovery of the Neutron Resource Lesson Famous Experiments: The Discovery of the Neutron Printer Friendly Version In 1920, Ernest Rutherford postulated that there were neutral, massive particles in the nucleus of atoms. This conclusion arose from the disparity between an element's atomic number (protons = electrons) and its atomic mass (usually in excess of the mass of the known protons present). James Chadwick was assigned the task of tracking down evidence of Rutherford's tightly bound \"proton-electron pair\" or neutron . In 1930 it was discovered that Beryllium, when bombarded by alpha particles, emitted a very energetic stream of radiation. This stream was originally thought to be gamma radiation.  However, further investigations into the properties of the radiation revealed contradictory results. Like gamma rays, these rays were extremely penetrating and since they were not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, neutral. However, unlike gamma rays, these rays did not discharge charged electroscopes (the photoelectric effect). Irene Curie and her husband discovered that when a beam of this radiation hit a substance rich in protons, for example paraffin, protons were knocked loose which could be easily detected by a Geiger counter. In 1932, Chadwick proposed that this particle was Rutherford's neutron. In 1935, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Using kinematics, Chadwick was able to determine the velocity of the protons. Then through conservation of momentum techniques, he was able to determine that the mass of the neutral radiation was almost exactly the same as that of a proton. This is Chadwick's equation: With Chadwick's announcement, Heisenberg then proposed the proton-neutron model for the nucleus. Rutherford was incorrect in his \"proton-electron\" pair - there were no \"free electrons\" in the nucleus. However, once free of the nucleus, evidence was mounting that these neutrons were unstable. By 1932, the products of beta decay had been thoroughly examined. To account for a broad spectrum of electron energies from a typical beta emitter, discussions were taking place in which leading physicists were considering abandoning the concepts of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy in radioactive decays. To bring empirical evidence back into alignment with these fundamental basic principles, Wolfgang Pauli proposed in 1930 the existence of an invisible particle that would carry off the missing energy and momentum. He called this particle the neutrino , or little neutral one. It wasn't until 1955 that Cowan and Reines, working with discharging radiation from the Savannah River Nuclear Power Plant with its abundant supply of antineutrinos released through the decay of free neutrons, discovered concrete experimental data to support the existence of neutrinos. Forty years later, in 1995, Frederick Reines was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work.

    "html": "Gravitational Potential Energy | Zona Land Education Gravitational Potential Energy The water above receives energy as it falls down the short waterfall. This energy was stored as potential energy in the gravitational field of the \n\tEarth and came out of storage as the water dropped. This energy which came \n\tout of the gravitational field ended up being expressed as the kinetic \n\tenergy of the water. That is, the water gains kinetic energy as it drops. An \n\tounce of water is going faster when it hits the bottom of the waterfall than \n\tit was when it went over the top of the waterfall. First Definition Energy that is stored in the gravitational field is called gravitational \n\tpotential energy, or potential energy due to gravity. Formula For Work Let's see how energy gets stored in the gravitational field. First of all, remember that work equals force times distance as stated in \n\tthis formula: The above formula for work shows a dot product for the multiplication of \n\tthe force vector times the displacement vector. If the force and \n\tdisplacement vectors are in the same direction, then this boils down to a \n\tsimple multiplication of the size of the force times the size of the \n\tdisplacement. This will be the case for our discussion here. Force Doing The Lifting Now, let's consider what happens when an object is being lifted. We will \n\tconsider lifting an object at constant velocity . That is, during the lift \n\tthe object will not be accelerating. For the moment we will not discuss the \n\tvery start of the lift, when the object must begin to move upward from a \n\tstationary position. Nor will we, for the moment at least, discuss the very \n\tend of the lift, when the object must slow to a stop after the upward motion \n\tis finished. Here, we are talking about the motion during the lift, and we \n\twill consider this motion to be directly upward and at constant speed. If the object is being lifted at constant velocity, then it \n\tis not accelerating, and the net force on it is zero. We know \n\tthat from Newton's first law of motion. We must pull up on an object when we lift it. So, the agent \n\tdoing the lifting must provide an upward force on the object. \n\tThis would be the yellow applied force in the animation at left. Gravity, of course, will be pulling down. This pull down of \n\tgravity is called the weight of the object. It is the blue \n\tdownward force in the animation at left. If during the lift the net force on the object is zero, then \n\tthe upward pull must be canceled by the downward pull. That is, \n\tthe upward lifting force must be equal in size to the downward \n\tpull of gravity. In summary, when you are lifting something at constant \n\tvelocity, the upward pull that you provide is equal to the \n\tweight of the object. When lifting something at a constant velocity.... The force that you lift with (applied force) Equals The weight of the object (gravitational force) Distance For The Lift Over what distance does this force act? Well, that would be the distance \n\tover which you lift the object. That distance we will call the height of the \n\tlift. Work Done Lifting Now, work is force times displacement. The force that you apply is equal \n\tto the weight of the object. The weight of the object is its mass times the \n\tacceleration due to gravity. And the displacement over which this work is \n\tdone is the height of the lift. So, the work done lifting an object is equal to its mass times the \n\tacceleration due to gravity times the height of the lift. This is summarized \n\tbelow: W= Fd Work equals the applied force times displacement. W= F g d The applied force equals the weight of the object. \n\t\t\t\t(F = F g ) W= mgd The weight of the object equals its mass times the acceleration due to gravity. \n\t\t\t\t(F g = mg) W= mgh The displacement over which the work is done \n\t\t\t\tequals the height of the lift. (d = h) Work Becomes Stored Energy This work which is done on the object as it is lifted does not end up as \n\tenergy of motion, or kinetic energy, since, after the lift, the object is \n\tnot moving; it is stationary. It is higher up, though. We say that the \n\tenergy has been stored in the gravitational field. This stored energy is \n\tcalled potential energy. Since it is energy in a gravitational field, it is \n\tcalled gravitational potential energy or potential energy due to gravity . The symbol for potential energy, in general, is U, and the symbol for \n\tgravitational potential energy is U g . U g Symbol for gravitational potential energy Since the work done on the object when it is lifted becomes the \n\tgravitational potential energy, the formula for \n\tgravitational potential energy equals the\n massif the object times the \n\tacceleration due to gravity times the height that the object is lifted, as in: U g = mgh Sample Calculation What is the gravitational potential energy for a 4 kg object that is \n\tlifted 5 m? Ug = mgh Formula for gravitational potential energy. Ug = (4 kg)(9.8 m/s/s)(5 m) Plug in values for mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height. Ug = 196 J Gravitational potential energy equals 196 Joules. Questions Here are some questions to work with using the above formula. 1 2 3 4 Release Of Potential Energy Once the work has been done lifting the object, and the energy has been \n\tstored in the gravitational field, how is this potential energy released? \n\tVery simply, the object can be dropped. As it falls its height above ground \n\tgets less and less, so, the potential energy stored in gravity gets less and \n\tless, also. The object, though, is speeding up as it falls. Energy is \n\tleaving the gravitational field and entering the falling object as kinetic \n\tenergy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. As the object falls it travels faster and faster, and thus, picks up more \n\tand more kinetic energy. This increase in kinetic energy during the fall is \n\tdue to the drop in gravitational potential energy during the fall. The \n\tgravitational potential energy becomes the kinetic energy of the falling \n\tobject. Energy Of Position Potential energy is often described as stored energy, and this is a fine \n\tdescription. However, a more sophisticated definition would be that \n\tpotential energy is the energy of position, or energy related to, or as a \n\tfunction of, position. Consider the two flower pots below. The one on the left is on the floor \n\tat ground level. The one on the right is several centimeters above ground \n\tlevel. Now, the one on the right is at a higher gravitational potential energy \n\tthan the one on the left. Of course, it is at a higher position. So, the \n\tpotential energy that each pot has is a function of its vertical position. \n\tIn fact, for any one mass on any one planet, the vertical position \n\tdetermines the amount of gravitational potential energy. Other forms of \n\tpotential energy are dependent upon position also. That is why potential \n\tenergy is often called the energy of position. See also: Mass on a Spring Scramble Puzzle",

U g Symbol for gravitational potential energy Since the work done on the object when it is lifted becomes the \n\tgravitational potential energy, the formula for \n\tgravitational potential energy equals the\n massif the object times the \n\tacceleration due to gravity times the height that the object is lifted, as in: U g = mgh Sample Calculation What is the gravitational potential energy for a 4 kg object that is \n\tlifted 5 m? Ug = mgh Formula for gravitational potential energy. Ug = (4 kg)(9.8 m/s/s)(5 m) Plug in values for mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height. Ug = 196 J Gravitational potential energy equals 196 Joules. Questions Here are some questions to work with using the above formula. 1 2 3 4 Release Of Potential Energy Once the work has been done lifting the object, and the energy has been \n\tstored in the gravitational field, how is this potential energy released? \n\tVery simply, the object can be dropped. As it falls its height above ground \n\tgets less and less, so, the potential energy stored in gravity gets less and \n\tless, also. The object, though, is speeding up as it falls. Energy is \n\tleaving the gravitational field and entering the falling object as kinetic \n\tenergy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. As the object falls it travels faster and faster, and thus, picks up more \n\tand more kinetic energy. This increase in kinetic energy during the fall is \n\tdue to the drop in gravitational potential energy during the fall. The \n\tgravitational potential energy becomes the kinetic energy of the falling \n\tobject. Energy Of Position Potential energy is often described as stored energy, and this is a fine \n\tdescription. However, a more sophisticated definition would be that \n\tpotential energy is the energy of position, or energy related to, or as a \n\tfunction of, position. Consider the two flower pots below. The one on the left is on the floor \n\tat ground level. The one on the right is several centimeters above ground \n\tlevel. Now, the one on the right is at a higher gravitational potential energy \n\tthan the one on the left. Of course, it is at a higher position. So, the \n\tpotential energy that each pot has is a function of its vertical position. \n\tIn fact, for any one mass on any one planet, the vertical position \n\tdetermines the amount of gravitational potential energy. Other forms of \n\tpotential energy are dependent upon position also. That is why potential \n\tenergy is often called the energy of position. See also: Mass on a Spring Scramble Puzzle"

Rose Quartz Dominion Rose Group Claims, Custer, Custer Mining District, Custer County, South Dakota, USA 1. One is found in translucent masses made of intergrown anhedral crystals. It occurs in different hues of pink, sometimes bluish, sometimes more reddish; irradiation may cause the formation of smoky quartz color centers and add a gray tone. Rose quartz is always showing a hazy to translucent character due to microscopic fibrous inclusions of a pink borosilicate mineral related to dumortierite (Applin and Hicks, 1987; Goreva et al, 2001; Ma et al, 2002), which group leader Rossman names \"dididumortierite\" (Nadin, 2007). These inclusions are probably the result of an exsolution from an initially homogeneous material. The color of the fibrous mineral as well as the color of rose quartz is stable up to temperatures of about 575°C (Lehmann and Bambauer, 1978; Goreva et al, 2001) and is also generally stable in ultraviolet light (Goreva et al, 2001), although there have been occasional reports of material that pales quickly in daylight. Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Rose quartz is dichroic, reflecting a preferential orientation of the included fibers. Star rose quartz Rose quartz from some localities shows asterism when cut as spheres or cabochons, much like that seen in certain sapphires. It is sometimes called star rose quartz . The six-rayed star is caused by reflections of the light from embedded fibers that intersect at an angle of 60°. The star's position depends both on the location of the light source and the position of the observer (Schmetzer and Krzemnicki, 2006; Killingback, 2008). Rose quartz is commonly found in the quartz cores of pegmatites and is believed to form at high temperatures, but it has also been found in hydrothermal veins. This variety is the rose quartz that is used in lapidary and carvings. Crystals of this type of rose quartz have never been found. Rose Quartz Alto da Pitorra, Laranjeiras, Galiléia, Minas Gerais, Brazil 2. The other variety occurs in well-formed crystals of similar color. Because of the substantial differences in the physical properties and causes of color it has been suggested to give the variety of pink-colored quartz that forms crystals the name \" pink quartz \"(Hori, 2001) or \" Rosaquarz \" (German for pink quartz, Rykart, 1995) but neither of these names have found widespread use. They are found as a late formation in pegmatite pockets, often overgrowing smoky quartz crystals in groups of parallel-grown crystals. According to Maschmeyer and Lehmann (1983), the color is caused by irradiation-induced color centers based on aluminum, Al, and phosphorous, P, that replace Si in the atom lattice. A synthetic counterpart has been synthesized, and irradiation-induced P-bearing color centers have found to be responsible for its color, too, but aluminum was absent (Balitsky et al 1998). The crystals are also slightly dichroic; the strongest color is observed when the polarization plane is perpendicular to the c-axis. UV-bleaching of euhedral rose quartz / pink quartz The color in both natural and synthetic specimens is very light- and heat sensitive (Balitsky et al 1998). An example for its UV-sensitivity is shown on the photo to the left: a natural specimen was completely bleached within 10 hours of UV irradiation. This is much faster than the bleaching observed in smoky quartz or amethyst, and specimen should be kept in the dark to preserve their color. Incorrect uses of the name The term \"rose quartz\" has also occasionally been used for quartz that is colored by other inclusions. Pale amethyst may be confused with euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz. Amethyst and euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz are both occasionally found overgrowing smoky quartz and may show similar sheet-like surface patterns. The non-destructive distinction between amethyst and euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz is difficult unless the crystals are free-standing. Then the different dichroic behaviour can be used to determine the variety: when the polarization of the light is changed from parallel to the c-axis to perpendicular to the c-axis, amethyst changes its color from bluish to reddish, whereas euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz changes from a more pale to a more intense pink color.

Click the show button to view. Formula: SiO 2 Colour: Pink Lustre: Vitreous A variety of Quartz Two varieties of quartz are commonly called \"rose quartz\". Rose Quartz Dominion Rose Group Claims, Custer, Custer Mining District, Custer County, South Dakota, USA 1. One is found in translucent masses made of intergrown anhedral crystals. It occurs in different hues of pink, sometimes bluish, sometimes more reddish; irradiation may cause the formation of smoky quartz color centers and add a gray tone. Rose quartz is always showing a hazy to translucent character due to microscopic fibrous inclusions of a pink borosilicate mineral related to dumortierite (Applin and Hicks, 1987; Goreva et al, 2001; Ma et al, 2002), which group leader Rossman names \"dididumortierite\" (Nadin, 2007). These inclusions are probably the result of an exsolution from an initially homogeneous material. The color of the fibrous mineral as well as the color of rose quartz is stable up to temperatures of about 575°C (Lehmann and Bambauer, 1978; Goreva et al, 2001) and is also generally stable in ultraviolet light (Goreva et al, 2001), although there have been occasional reports of material that pales quickly in daylight. Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Pink fibers extracted from rose quartz SEM image of pink fibers TEM image of pink fibers Rose quartz is dichroic, reflecting a preferential orientation of the included fibers. Star rose quartz Rose quartz from some localities shows asterism when cut as spheres or cabochons, much like that seen in certain sapphires. It is sometimes called star rose quartz . The six-rayed star is caused by reflections of the light from embedded fibers that intersect at an angle of 60°. The star's position depends both on the location of the light source and the position of the observer (Schmetzer and Krzemnicki, 2006; Killingback, 2008). Rose quartz is commonly found in the quartz cores of pegmatites and is believed to form at high temperatures, but it has also been found in hydrothermal veins. This variety is the rose quartz that is used in lapidary and carvings. Crystals of this type of rose quartz have never been found. Rose Quartz Alto da Pitorra, Laranjeiras, Galiléia, Minas Gerais, Brazil 2. The other variety occurs in well-formed crystals of similar color. Because of the substantial differences in the physical properties and causes of color it has been suggested to give the variety of pink-colored quartz that forms crystals the name \" pink quartz \"(Hori, 2001) or \" Rosaquarz \" (German for pink quartz, Rykart, 1995) but neither of these names have found widespread use. They are found as a late formation in pegmatite pockets, often overgrowing smoky quartz crystals in groups of parallel-grown crystals. According to Maschmeyer and Lehmann (1983), the color is caused by irradiation-induced color centers based on aluminum, Al, and phosphorous, P, that replace Si in the atom lattice. A synthetic counterpart has been synthesized, and irradiation-induced P-bearing color centers have found to be responsible for its color, too, but aluminum was absent (Balitsky et al 1998). The crystals are also slightly dichroic; the strongest color is observed when the polarization plane is perpendicular to the c-axis. UV-bleaching of euhedral rose quartz / pink quartz The color in both natural and synthetic specimens is very light- and heat sensitive (Balitsky et al 1998). An example for its UV-sensitivity is shown on the photo to the left: a natural specimen was completely bleached within 10 hours of UV irradiation. This is much faster than the bleaching observed in smoky quartz or amethyst, and specimen should be kept in the dark to preserve their color. Incorrect uses of the name The term \"rose quartz\" has also occasionally been used for quartz that is colored by other inclusions. Pale amethyst may be confused with euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz. Amethyst and euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz are both occasionally found overgrowing smoky quartz and may show similar sheet-like surface patterns. The non-destructive distinction between amethyst and euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz is difficult unless the crystals are free-standing. Then the different dichroic behaviour can be used to determine the variety: when the polarization of the light is changed from parallel to the c-axis to perpendicular to the c-axis, amethyst changes its color from bluish to reddish, whereas euhedral rose quartz/pink quartz changes from a more pale to a more intense pink color.

    "html": "64 Types of Falcons (With Pictures) - Avibirds.com Search Search Search Menu Menu Search Search Search Menu 64 Types of Falcons (With Pictures) Add comment Share: Facebook X Pinterest Menu 64 Types of Falcons (With Pictures) by Allan McLennan 8 months ago Order Falconiformes Family Falconidae The Falconidae family includes falcons, kestrels, and caracaras. Small to medium-sized diurnal raptors differ from hawks and their allies by using their beaks instead of their feet to kill prey. Falconiformes have hooked bills, sharply curved talons, and excellent eyesight. They also have relatively long, pointed wings made for speed and lift. Their plumage typically consists of browns, whites, chestnut, blacks, and greys, often with barring or patterning. Females are larger than males, and their plumages have little difference. Virtually all the core falcons have a tomial “tooth,” which is a notch in the cutting edge of the upper bill. Many forest falcons have bare facial skin and a soft mass near the base called a cere, as do almost all caracaras. 1. Genus Caracara They are found in North and South America. 1.1. Crested Caracara or Northern Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway) Description : Crested Caracaras have striking and noticeable long flattened black crown feathers that can resemble crests when raised. They have bright orange-red faces, bluish bills, and long yellow legs. Their lores, malars, and suborbital areas are naked. The colors of their facial skin rely on their age and mood. They have black upperparts, upper wing coverts, and bellies. Their necks, mantles, and breasts are white, and they become black-tipped with fine blackish chevrons. Their tails are whitish with broad black terminal bands. Length – 19-24 inches (49-64 cm) Weight – 32-56 ounces (900-1600 g) Wingspan – 47-51 inches (120-130 cm) Similar to Southern Caracaras , Northern Caracaras are not found in North America, and Northern Crested Caracaras are not found in Argentina. Northern Crested Caracaras have blackish lower backs, while Southern Caracaras are pale with dark barring. Habitat : Crested Caracaras prefer open or semi-open habitats such as grasslands, pastures, pampas, and ranch lands with cattle. They can also be found near humans and may concentrate near food sources. Conservation : IUCN has listed Crested Caracaras as Least Concern (LC). Distribution : Crested Caracaras have fragmented distributions. They breed from southeastern Peru and northern Bolivia to eastern Brazil. They winter south to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. 1.2. Southern Caracara or Southern Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus) Description : Southern Caracaras have striking and noticeable bright orange-red faces, bluish bills, long yellow legs, and long flattened black crown feathers that can resemble crests when raised. Their lores, malars, and suborbital areas are naked. The colors of their facial skin rely on their age and mood. They have greyish upperparts with black barring, upper wing coverts, and bellies. Their necks, mantles, and breasts are white, and they become black-tipped with fine blackish chevrons. Their tails are whitish with a broad black terminal band. Length – 19-24 inches (49-64 cm) Weight – 32-56 ounces (900-1600 g) Wingspan – 47-51 inches (120-130 cm) Similar to Northern Caracaras, Southern Caracaras are not found in North America, and Northern Caracaras are not found in Argentina. Northern Crested Caracaras have blackish lower backs; Southern Caracaras are pale with dark barring. Habitat : Crested Caracaras prefer open or semi-open habitats such as grasslands, pastures, pampas, and ranch lands with cattle. They can also be found near humans and may concentrate near food sources. Conservation : IUCN has listed Southern Crested Caracaras as Least Concern (LC). Distribution. Southern Crested are found in Central and Southern America. 2. Genus Daptrius There is only one species in this genus. 2.1. Black Caracaras (Daptrius ater) Description : Black Caracaras have glossy black plumage with a distinctive white band on the base of their tails with white rumps, red-yellow bare facial skin, and yellow legs. Length – 16-19 inches (41-47 cm) Weight – Average 12 ounces (330 g) Wingspan – 36-39 inches (91-100 cm) Habitat : Black Caracaras inhabitgallery and secondary forestsand woodedsavannas. They can also be found in mangroves and disturbed and recently burnt forested habitats along the rivers. Conservation : IUCN has listed Black Caracaras as Least Concern (LC). Distribution : Black Caracaras are found in Northeast and East Colombia, Northwest, South, and East Venezuela, as well as the Guianas.

Small to medium-sized diurnal raptors differ from hawks and their allies by using their beaks instead of their feet to kill prey. Falconiformes have hooked bills, sharply curved talons, and excellent eyesight. They also have relatively long, pointed wings made for speed and lift. Their plumage typically consists of browns, whites, chestnut, blacks, and greys, often with barring or patterning. Females are larger than males, and their plumages have little difference. Virtually all the core falcons have a tomial “tooth,” which is a notch in the cutting edge of the upper bill. Many forest falcons have bare facial skin and a soft mass near the base called a cere, as do almost all caracaras. 1. Genus Caracara They are found in North and South America. 1.1. Crested Caracara or Northern Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway) Description : Crested Caracaras have striking and noticeable long flattened black crown feathers that can resemble crests when raised. They have bright orange-red faces, bluish bills, and long yellow legs. Their lores, malars, and suborbital areas are naked. The colors of their facial skin rely on their age and mood. They have black upperparts, upper wing coverts, and bellies. Their necks, mantles, and breasts are white, and they become black-tipped with fine blackish chevrons. Their tails are whitish with broad black terminal bands. Length – 19-24 inches (49-64 cm) Weight – 32-56 ounces (900-1600 g) Wingspan – 47-51 inches (120-130 cm) Similar to Southern Caracaras , Northern Caracaras are not found in North America, and Northern Crested Caracaras are not found in Argentina. Northern Crested Caracaras have blackish lower backs, while Southern Caracaras are pale with dark barring. Habitat : Crested Caracaras prefer open or semi-open habitats such as grasslands, pastures, pampas, and ranch lands with cattle. They can also be found near humans and may concentrate near food sources. Conservation : IUCN has listed Crested Caracaras as Least Concern (LC). Distribution : Crested Caracaras have fragmented distributions. They breed from southeastern Peru and northern Bolivia to eastern Brazil.

Conclusion The falcon family is truly fascinating, showcasing an incredible array of raptors. From the breathtaking speed of the Peregrine Falcons to the enigmatic nature of the Forest-Falcons, and from the robust Caracaras to the diminutive Pygmy Falcons, the diversity within this group of birds is truly remarkable. These majestic creatures captivate us with their aerial prowess and unique characteristics. Unfortunately, certain falcon populations are at risk due to deforestation, pollution, and human persecution. Thankfully, various initiatives have been implemented to raise awareness about these threats and to safeguard their natural habitats, which provides a glimmer of hope for their well-being.

For one-tail tests, multiply α by 2” I think it should be divide by two – unless i have missed something there ? Reply Charles, For the critical values, you multiply by 2. Charles Reply Thanks for the reply. To save me going into a long explanation of tails – I give this popular example – the first hit on the internet for this table – https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/pearsons-correlation-coefficient/table-of-critical-values-pearson-correlation/ (I wanted to inlcude a picture, but seems not possible). You will see that the probabilities for one tailed in this table are half the probabilities for two tailed. Thus I agree with your table – and the comment that the table contains values for two tail – but for one tail it should be halved, not doubled. Reply Hi Charles, The example you sent me seems to support the conclusion that the alpha value for a one-tailed test is half that for a two-tailed test, but let me suggest another example that supports a different conclusion. 1. The example is a t-test based on two independent samples of size 4 with the t-stat = 2.09477. We use a significance level of alpha = .05 2. For the two-tailed test the p-value = T.DIST.2T(2.09477,6,TRUE) = .081062, which indicates a non-significant result. 3. For the one-tailed test the p-value = T.DIST.RT(2.09477,6,TRUE) = .040531, which indicates a significant result. In general, the p-value for the one-tailed test is half that of the two-tailed test. It is always easier to obtain a significant result with a one-tailed test compared with a two-tailed test. 4. We now perform the same test using critical values instead of p-values. For the two-tailed test the t-crit = T.INV.2T(.05,6) = 2.446912, which indicates a non-significant result since t-crit = 2.446912 > 2.09477 = t-stat. 5. If the critical value for the one-tailed test is the same as the critical for the two-tailed test with alpha divided by 2, we would get t-crit = T.INV.2T(.025,6) = 2.968687 > 2.09477 = t-stat, and so once again we see that the result is not significant, which contradicts the result we got using the p-value. 6. If instead, the critical value for the one-tailed test is the same as the critical value for the two-tailed test with alpha multiplied by 2, we get t-crit = T.INV.2T(.1,6) = 1.94318 < 2.09477 = t-stat, and so the result is significant, consistent with the result we got using the p-value.\n7. Finally, note that the formula for the one-tailed critical value in Excel is T.INV(1-.05,6) = 1.94318 or alternatively, -T.INV(.05,6) = 1.94318, which the same as the result we got above.\nCharles Reply Charles – Thank you very much for that well considered and thought out answer. It gave me food for thought. The logic of 2-tail testing, as devised by Mr Fisher, seems to be that if you allow your test to hit either tail, then you increase (double in fact) the p-value of the result you get. You have, of course, a better chance of hitting two targets than one. Alternatively – the way it’s usually done in the tables – is to share the significance level equally between the two tails, and then use the one tail column of the table. Hence go to the one tail column, but use half the 2-tail significance level. Already I’m being obliged to admit confusion between halving and doubling.! Looking at your own results it is interesting to note that T.INV.2T (0.1, 6) = -T.INV (0.05, 6) = 1.94318 Here we see a halving of the 2-tail probability into the 1-tail. I fall back on this rather weak defence – simply that the way it is conventionally done in tables is to have two banner lines at the top, with 2-tail and 1-tail probabilities. The 1-tail is always half the 2-tail. The generated tables are for 1-tail really, and then reused for 2-tail. Indeed, in your own website, you cross reference ‘Aspelmeier, J. (2005) Table of critical values for Pearson’s r’ and if you look at his table, you see he follows this usual convention. Finally, my own entirely personal comment on two tail testing. I think it is a nonsense. In real life we always have a theory about which way things are going and we use statistics to test it. The idea that we would ever have a test where we have no expectation of a particular type of outcome strikes me as completely unrealistic – and the method of dealing with it somewhat arbitrary.! However – unfortunately – the examiners love it.! Charles, This is confusing, also for me. I have spent a fair amount if time trying to understand what seems like a simple concept. For example, in your comment, you stated that “Looking at your own results it is interesting to note that T.INV.2T (0.1, 6) = -T.INV (0.05, 6) = 1.94318 Here we see a halving of the 2-tail probability into the 1-tail.” Actually, starting from the 1-tailed test, we needed to double alpha (from .05 to .1) and then use the two-tailed test. Note “double”, not “half”. It almost seems like relativity theory: “doubling” becomes “halving” from a different perspective. Charles I couldn’t find a reply button for the latest so I’m using this older one. Sorry – I don’t know if you actually wanted to bring this conversation to an end – quite understandable if you did.! (If we did want to continue, we could use email – to avoid cluttering your website with all this stuff.) Charles.bowyer@hotmail.co.uk I agree you are right to say that using excel to get a 1 tail value from a 2 tail test you need to double the probability. I think that excel then halves the probability given, and uses 1 tail.! And of course halving is doubling from a different perspective.! It’s just the direction of travel. Go one way it’s halving, go backwards it’s doubling. I just do think that it would be less confusing if your website followed the widespread convention for how the r values are tabulated and tested…? By the way – thank you for your answers. I have enjoyed the discussion – and it has made me think !! What if the calculated value and table is values is the same, those it reject or accept Null hypothesis Reply Allen, It is borderline. Since the alpha value is somewhat arbitrary anyway (even if it is usually set to .05), you are probably ok deciding either way. Technically, though, if p-value = alpha or calculated value = critical value, then you reject the null hypothesis. Charles Reply What if my data frame has 80,000 rows of data? Reply You don’t really need to use the table in this case. Instead, you can use the test as described at https://www.real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply Hi Mr. Charles, i want to ask you.. if our df is 273 what is our critical value? thank you Reply NB: sign = 5% or 0.05 Reply Hi Ticha, You can interpolate between the 250 and 300 values from the table, which yields a value near .118. Better yet, you don’t really need to use the table at all. You can use the t-test described at https://www.real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply what if n value is between 2000 and 3000 Reply You can interpolate between the values in the table as explained at Interpolation Alternatively, you can use one the tests described at https://www.real-statistics.com/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/ Charles Reply Hi if our df is 48 what is our critical value? Reply You need to interpolate between the 45 and 50 values. See Interpolation Charles Reply I am trying to formulate an index based on addition of a few relevant variables (i.e. ratios of actual/reference condition). Is there any system of assigning weightage to different variables as all of them may not be equally influencing the index ? For ex. if a variable is very much influencial, I assign 1 (unity, like a perfect correlation coefficient) to the variable or ratio, making the value of variable unaltered. But, if a variable is low or moderate in importance, what weightage should I assign ? The weightage must be <1 and after assigning (or multiplying with) the weightage, the variable would reduce in value so that its influence to the index gets lower, justifying its lower importance. If I am right in my above assumption, exactly what should be the values of low and moderate weightages and based on what logic ? I hope I am clear ? Reply What if my df= 38 but in the table there’s none how will I know what is my critical value Reply You can interpolate between the 35 and 40 values. See Interpolation Charles Reply Hi Mr. Charles, How many decimal places should I use for the t critical and t computed? Reply Kaylie, I suggest that you use all the decimal places you can for all the data values. Only at the end should you round off. The number of decimal places is usually determined by the journal you are publishing in or the needs of your audience. Charles Reply Hello Mr .Charles.

Thanks much! Reply What hypothesis are you testing? Charles Reply The correlation between two percepts tested in 3 locations with repeated measures. Reply That is not a hypothesis. Is your hypothesis that this correlation is zero? Charles Reply Yes. What’s the df then? Thanks so much and happy holidays! df = n-2 where n = the size of each sample. Charles Hello, Charles. If I have an n of 628, two-tailed. What would be my df? Reply df = 628-2 = 626 See https://real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply Hello Charles. Thank you for the clear explanation! However, if I have R^2 = 0.2 for dof = 400 does it mean (according to the table of critical values) that there is a correlation between two values? In other words, does rejection of null-hypothesis that there is no correlation makes me able to claim that there is correlation? Thank you. Reply Hello Maksim, The null hypothesis is that the correlation is zero (i.e. “there is no correlation”). If the test rejects the null-hypothesis, then you are 95% confident that there is a correlation (assuming that alpha = .05). When using the table of critical values, remember that R^2 does not represent the correlation. The square root of R^2 represents the correlation, which in this case is .4472. Charles Reply What will be the critical value for n=66, r=.750 and sig. lvl =0.01? Reply You need to interpolate between the table values at n = 60 and n = 70 where alpha = .01. Charles Reply Hi Charles, what will be the critical value at n = 284, tails = 2, alpha = .01? Reply You can interpolate between the n = 250 and n = 300 values in the table. Charles Reply Thanks for your explanation here. In addition, can you present this in a table with a hypothetical case? Reply Hi Hillary, See https://real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/ Charles Reply what will be the table value for 48 sample size and at sig level 0.05 if r = 0.2715 Reply The critical value at n = 48, tails = 2, alpha = .05 is .284519. You can interpolate between the values in the table at 45 and 50. Alternatively, you can use the Real Statistics PCRIT function.

The example is a t-test based on two independent samples of size 4 with the t-stat = 2.09477. We use a significance level of alpha = .05 2. For the two-tailed test the p-value = T.DIST.2T(2.09477,6,TRUE) = .081062, which indicates a non-significant result. 3. For the one-tailed test the p-value = T.DIST.RT(2.09477,6,TRUE) = .040531, which indicates a significant result. In general, the p-value for the one-tailed test is half that of the two-tailed test. It is always easier to obtain a significant result with a one-tailed test compared with a two-tailed test. 4. We now perform the same test using critical values instead of p-values. For the two-tailed test the t-crit = T.INV.2T(.05,6) = 2.446912, which indicates a non-significant result since t-crit = 2.446912 > 2.09477 = t-stat. 5. If the critical value for the one-tailed test is the same as the critical for the two-tailed test with alpha divided by 2, we would get t-crit = T.INV.2T(.025,6) = 2.968687 > 2.09477 = t-stat, and so once again we see that the result is not significant, which contradicts the result we got using the p-value. 6. If instead, the critical value for the one-tailed test is the same as the critical value for the two-tailed test with alpha multiplied by 2, we get t-crit = T.INV.2T(.1,6) = 1.94318 < 2.09477 = t-stat, and so the result is significant, consistent with the result we got using the p-value.\n7. Finally, note that the formula for the one-tailed critical value in Excel is T.INV(1-.05,6) = 1.94318 or alternatively, -T.INV(.05,6) = 1.94318, which the same as the result we got above.\nCharles Reply Charles – Thank you very much for that well considered and thought out answer. It gave me food for thought. The logic of 2-tail testing, as devised by Mr Fisher, seems to be that if you allow your test to hit either tail, then you increase (double in fact) the p-value of the result you get. You have, of course, a better chance of hitting two targets than one. Alternatively – the way it’s usually done in the tables – is to share the significance level equally between the two tails, and then use the one tail column of the table. Hence go to the one tail column, but use half the 2-tail significance level. Already I’m being obliged to admit confusion between halving and doubling.! Looking at your own results it is interesting to note that T.INV.2T (0.1, 6) = -T.INV (0.05, 6) = 1.94318 Here we see a halving of the 2-tail probability into the 1-tail. I fall back on this rather weak defence – simply that the way it is conventionally done in tables is to have two banner lines at the top, with 2-tail and 1-tail probabilities. The 1-tail is always half the 2-tail. The generated tables are for 1-tail really, and then reused for 2-tail. Indeed, in your own website, you cross reference ‘Aspelmeier, J. (2005) Table of critical values for Pearson’s r’ and if you look at his table, you see he follows this usual convention. Finally, my own entirely personal comment on two tail testing. I think it is a nonsense. In real life we always have a theory about which way things are going and we use statistics to test it. The idea that we would ever have a test where we have no expectation of a particular type of outcome strikes me as completely unrealistic – and the method of dealing with it somewhat arbitrary.! However – unfortunately – the examiners love it.! Charles, This is confusing, also for me. I have spent a fair amount if time trying to understand what seems like a simple concept. For example, in your comment, you stated that “Looking at your own results it is interesting to note that T.INV.2T (0.1, 6) = -T.INV (0.05, 6) = 1.94318 Here we see a halving of the 2-tail probability into the 1-tail.” Actually, starting from the 1-tailed test, we needed to double alpha (from .05 to .1) and then use the two-tailed test. Note “double”, not “half”. It almost seems like relativity theory: “doubling” becomes “halving” from a different perspective. Charles I couldn’t find a reply button for the latest so I’m using this older one. Sorry – I don’t know if you actually wanted to bring this conversation to an end – quite understandable if you did.! (If we did want to continue, we could use email – to avoid cluttering your website with all this stuff.) Charles.bowyer@hotmail.co.uk I agree you are right to say that using excel to get a 1 tail value from a 2 tail test you need to double the probability. I think that excel then halves the probability given, and uses 1 tail.! And of course halving is doubling from a different perspective.! It’s just the direction of travel. Go one way it’s halving, go backwards it’s doubling. I just do think that it would be less confusing if your website followed the widespread convention for how the r values are tabulated and tested…? By the way – thank you for your answers. I have enjoyed the discussion – and it has made me think !! What if the calculated value and table is values is the same, those it reject or accept Null hypothesis Reply Allen, It is borderline. Since the alpha value is somewhat arbitrary anyway (even if it is usually set to .05), you are probably ok deciding either way. Technically, though, if p-value = alpha or calculated value = critical value, then you reject the null hypothesis. Charles Reply What if my data frame has 80,000 rows of data? Reply You don’t really need to use the table in this case. Instead, you can use the test as described at https://www.real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply Hi Mr. Charles, i want to ask you.. if our df is 273 what is our critical value? thank you Reply NB: sign = 5% or 0.05 Reply Hi Ticha, You can interpolate between the 250 and 300 values from the table, which yields a value near .118. Better yet, you don’t really need to use the table at all. You can use the t-test described at https://www.real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply what if n value is between 2000 and 3000 Reply You can interpolate between the values in the table as explained at Interpolation Alternatively, you can use one the tests described at https://www.real-statistics.com/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/ Charles Reply Hi if our df is 48 what is our critical value? Reply You need to interpolate between the 45 and 50 values. See Interpolation Charles Reply I am trying to formulate an index based on addition of a few relevant variables (i.e. ratios of actual/reference condition). Is there any system of assigning weightage to different variables as all of them may not be equally influencing the index ? For ex. if a variable is very much influencial, I assign 1 (unity, like a perfect correlation coefficient) to the variable or ratio, making the value of variable unaltered. But, if a variable is low or moderate in importance, what weightage should I assign ? The weightage must be <1 and after assigning (or multiplying with) the weightage, the variable would reduce in value so that its influence to the index gets lower, justifying its lower importance. If I am right in my above assumption, exactly what should be the values of low and moderate weightages and based on what logic ? I hope I am clear ? Reply What if my df= 38 but in the table there’s none how will I know what is my critical value Reply You can interpolate between the 35 and 40 values. See Interpolation Charles Reply Hi Mr. Charles, How many decimal places should I use for the t critical and t computed? Reply Kaylie, I suggest that you use all the decimal places you can for all the data values. Only at the end should you round off. The number of decimal places is usually determined by the journal you are publishing in or the needs of your audience. Charles Reply Hello Mr .Charles. How can I do the pearson’s correlation cofficient of the research question,what is the level of relationship between competencies in pedagogical knowledge and current teaching practice displayed by Governmental and private pre-school teachers Reply Hello Mohamed, You can use Excel’s CORREL function. See Basic Concepts of Correlation Charles Reply Hello, Charles. If I have an 20 results from 20 differents laboratories and each laboratory tested 3 times 4 similar specimens. What would be my df? Is-it 20 -(3-1)(4-1)? thx! Reply Cyril, What hypothesis are you testing and how does this relate to the Pearson-s Correlation Table_ Charles Reply Hello Charles, Is there a statistical test to interpolate or is it just based off which number is closest? Regards, Joe Reply You can use interpolation. See Interpolation . Charles Reply Hi, Charles, If N=16 and I have tested them in 3 conditions for a total of 168 conditions with 2 repetitions (i.e., total entry = 336 for the whole correlation data set), what would be my df? Thanks much! Reply What hypothesis are you testing? Charles Reply The correlation between two percepts tested in 3 locations with repeated measures. Reply That is not a hypothesis. Is your hypothesis that this correlation is zero? Charles Reply Yes. What’s the df then? Thanks so much and happy holidays! df = n-2 where n = the size of each sample. Charles Hello, Charles. If I have an n of 628, two-tailed. What would be my df? Reply df = 628-2 = 626 See https://real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/correlation-testing-via-t-test/ Charles Reply Hello Charles. Thank you for the clear explanation! However, if I have R^2 = 0.2 for dof = 400 does it mean (according to the table of critical values) that there is a correlation between two values? In other words, does rejection of null-hypothesis that there is no correlation makes me able to claim that there is correlation? Thank you. Reply Hello Maksim, The null hypothesis is that the correlation is zero (i.e. “there is no correlation”). If the test rejects the null-hypothesis, then you are 95% confident that there is a correlation (assuming that alpha = .05). When using the table of critical values, remember that R^2 does not represent the correlation. The square root of R^2 represents the correlation, which in this case is .4472. Charles Reply What will be the critical value for n=66, r=.750 and sig. lvl =0.01? Reply You need to interpolate between the table values at n = 60 and n = 70 where alpha = .01. Charles Reply Hi Charles, what will be the critical value at n = 284, tails = 2, alpha = .01? Reply You can interpolate between the n = 250 and n = 300 values in the table. Charles Reply Thanks for your explanation here. In addition, can you present this in a table with a hypothetical case? Reply Hi Hillary, See https://real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/ Charles Reply what will be the table value for 48 sample size and at sig level 0.05 if r = 0.2715 Reply The critical value at n = 48, tails = 2, alpha = .05 is .284519. You can interpolate between the values in the table at 45 and 50. Alternatively, you can use the Real Statistics PCRIT function. Charles Reply Is there an excel formula for the calculation rather than using this table? Reply Hello Tisha, Yes, see the following webpage https://real-statistics.com/correlation/one-sample-hypothesis-testing-correlation/ Charles Reply very happy for visiting ur website. thank u Reply Hello Mr. Charles, I am happy to see such a good site having good explanation of important statistical tools. Really helpful for researchers. Congratulations to you sir. Reply Hello Mr. Charles, Hello, Mr. Charles. If I have an n of 231 two-tailed. What would be my df and its tabular value using the pearson r? Reply Reply Hello Jean, df = 231-2 = 229. You need to interpolate between the 200 and 250 values in the table or you can use the Real Statistics PCRIT function.

    "html": "What are the colours of the rainbow? - Met Office Skip to main content Menu Met Office Search site Search x Back Settings Learn What are the colours of the rainbow? The colours you see when a rainbow appears are the result of light being split into its various individual wavelengths. This gives us a spectrum of colours that range from the shorter blue and violet wavelengths through to the longer red wavelengths. Who discovered the rainbow? The Greek philosopher Aristotle first started musing about rainbows and their colours back in 350 BC. His ideas were picked up and elaborated upon by the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in his Book 1 of Naturales Quaestiones around 65 AD. Senaca was surprisingly ahead of his time in his reasoning, even predicting the discovery of the prism effect by Newton centuries later. Throughout the ages, thinkers, philosophers and naturalists examined the phenomenon of the rainbow effect, noting its appearance not just in the sky but in other circumstances too. But in every case, two elements were essential for that characteristic burst of colour, water vapour or droplets and sunlight. Finally, Isaac Newton proved that white light is made up of a spectrum of colours by splitting light with a prism. His discovery, together with the work of others before him, finally explained how rainbows form. He also noted that the sequence of the colours of a rainbow never changed, always running in the same order. He coined the idea that there are seven colours in a spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (ROYGBIV). It is said that he actually only observed five colours, but added orange and indigo, to align the number of colours with the number of notes in the musical scale. Most modern definitions of the spectrum of visible light exclude indigo, merging it into the ranges of shades of blue and violet. The colours of a rainbow The idea that there are seven colours in the rainbow still lasts to this day. At a glance, you might think this to be true, but closer inspection of a rainbow shows that there are far more than just seven individual hues. A rainbow is not a pure spectrum. It is actually made up of a myriad of individual spectral colours that have overlapped and mixed. The basic sequence for primary rainbows is always the same running from: Red (the longest wavelength at around 780 nm) through to Violet (the shortest wavelength in the sequence at 380 nm). The seven colour idea is still a popular one and it helps remember the order of the most recognisable colours in a rainbow. However, remember that there is also a whole range of colours, so many that we cannot distinguish them all with the naked eye. You might also like Learn How are rainbows formed?

    "html": "50 ideas to teach students about States of Matter 50 ideas to teach students about States of Matter Ben Newsome CF Author Help students understand States of Matter with these student project ideas for your classroom. Below are 50 lesson ideas that will help form a vibrant teaching sequence that kids will love! DIY Solids, Liquids, Gases Chart Students can create a large chart with different sections for solids, liquids, and gases, adding examples to each section and characteristics that define each state. This project allows them to apply their understanding of the properties of each state of matter. Ice Melting Experiment This experiment involves observing and documenting the transformation of water from a solid state to a liquid state. Students can use a timer to record how long it takes for ice to melt at room temperature, outdoors, and in a warm water bath. Water Evaporation Investigation\nStudents can put a small amount of water in a shallow dish and mark the water level. They then observe and record changes over several days to understand the process of evaporation. Balloon Expansion Students can learn about gases by inflating balloons and placing them in different temperatures. They can observe how the balloon expands or contracts, thus understanding the properties of gases. Sublimation Demonstration Teachers can demonstrate sublimation using dry ice. Students can see the dry ice turn directly from a solid to a gas, skipping the liquid state. The Magic of Oobleck Mix cornflour with water to make a non-Newtonian fluid that acts like a solid when you punch it but flows like a liquid when you pour it. DIY Lava Lamp Students can make a homemade lava lamp using vegetable oil, water, food colouring, and an effervescent tablet to learn about liquid density and chemical reactions. Marshmallow Molecules Using marshmallows and toothpicks, students can create models of molecules, seeing how atoms bond together in different states of matter. Evaporation Art Students can create artwork with washable markers on filter paper. Then, by dripping water on the paper, they can see how water can move and take the colours with it through evaporation. Baking Soda and Vinegar Balloon Experiment In this experiment, students mix baking soda and vinegar to produce carbon dioxide, inflating a balloon and demonstrating gas production. Ice Cube Challenge This challenge requires students to think about the quickest way to melt an ice cube without using any form of heat. States of Matter Skit Students can create a skit or a role-play showing the transformation of matter from one state to another. Animated States of Matter Using animation software, students can create short animations explaining the states of matter. Making Butter Students can make butter from cream to understand the process of a liquid turning into a solid. Matter Hunt In this activity, students look for items around the school or home and categorize them as solid, liquid, or gas. Matter in Cooking Students can explore the role of different states of matter in cooking and baking, seeing how heat changes matter. Be sure to follow school safety procedures on heat. Melting Chocolate Experiment Students can conduct an experiment to see how different types of chocolate melt at different temperatures. Podcast on States of Matter Students can create a podcast episode, explaining the states of matter in their own words and discussing their favourite experiments. States of Matter Collage Students can cut out pictures from magazines and make a collage of different states of matter. Popcorn Science By popping corn, students can see how heat causes water to turn into steam, leading to the popcorn 'pop.' Be sure to follow school safety procedures on heat.

    "html": "Math Tutor Explains: What is 4 to the Power of 3? | Thinkster Math Math Tutor Explains: What is 4 to the Power of 3? A math tutor would explain that to solve for 4 to the power of 3, we must first understand the structure. The number 4 is called the base, and the number 3 is called the exponent. In short, the base must be multiplied by itself the number of times as the exponent. Let’s look at this problem in more detail. Math Tutor's Solution: 4 to the Power of 3 is equal to 64 Methods Step-by-step from math tutor: finding 4 to the power of 3 The first step a math tutor would suggest is to understand what it means when a number has an exponent. The “power” of a number indicates how many times the base would be multiplied by itself to reach the correct value. The second step is to write the number in the base-exponent form, and lastly calculate what the final result would be. Consider the example of 2 to the power of 4: in exponent form that would be 2 4 2^4 2 4 . To solve this, we need to multiply the base, 2 by itself, 4 times - 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 16. So 2 4 = 16 2^4 = 16 2 4 = 16 . So re-applying these steps to our particular problem, we first convert our word problem to a base-exponent form of: 4 3 4^{3} 4 3 To simplify this, all that is needed is to multiply it out: 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 Therefore, 4 to the power of 3 is 64. Math Tutor Suggests: Try related exponent problems Our math tutors suggest reviewing other exponent problems that you can practice with! What is 9 to the Power of 20? What is 26 to the Power of 29? What is 12 to the Power of 19? What is 28 to the Power of 67? What is 15 to the Power of 4?

In fact, the emu is the second largest in the world, after the ostrich. Extremely large beaks, stilt-like legs and long necks are what set these birds apart. These guys are also among the last survivors of some mostly extinct bird groups. Here, we look at some of their defining attributes – comically stealthy runs and all – and why we’re lucky to have them here in Australia. Emu ( Dromaius novaehollandiae ) Size: up to 1.9m, 60kg An emu ( Dromaius novaehollandiae ). Image credit: shutterstock There’s a lot to love about emus, from the way they run scared and confused from your backyard sprinkler , to their wild, excited dancing . The emu is a member of the genus Dromaius, of which it is the only living member. Other members of the genus including the Tasmanian emu and King Island emu are now extinct. The  resilience of the last living emus is best exemplified in the story of the emu wars . Back in 1932, Australian troops were dumbfounded when they found themselves outmaneuvered. A group of 20,000 emus had been devastating farms across WA for some time. The farmers under attack (many ex-soldiers themselves) had eventually petitioned for military aid. Once the conflict began, the emus proved almost impossible to hit with machine-gun fire, and they seemed able to shrug off even serious injury from bullets without breaking stride. If this doesn’t make you love them or, at least, respect them, then their weather-reading skills will. Young emus learn to read the weather based on how their fathers react to different conditions. This is because the father has learnt that thunder clouds mean rain and that rain means grass and herbage, so when he is cued to move he heads towards the biggest cloud bank he can see. So yes, they’re also very smart. Southern cassowary ( Casuarius casuarius ) Size: up to 1.8m, 55kg Southern cassowary ( Casuarius casuarius ). Image credit: Unsplash These incredible, ancient birds are one-of-a-kind, literally – they’re one of the last existing species of megafauna. But despite their large size, they’re notoriously difficult to spot. In fact, photographers have even resorted to using fake fruit lures to get even a glimpse of the bird . And boy can they run! Their enormously powerful legs can carry them hundreds of metres away from you in seconds, and the tangled understory of their habitat, including the Daintree rainforest, doesn’t slow them down, instead they effortlessly glide through it. Indeed, they know the rainforest very, very well. Female southern cassowaries have often been described as ‘rainforest gardeners’, helping to propagate hundreds of different species of fruit. Because of its importance to the rainforest ecosystem, cassowaries are considered to be keystone species and their decline would be detrimental. Also, ever wondered what’s inside the cassowary’s casque (the appendage on their head)? Well, an autopsy revealed that it’s filled with a spongey, honeycomb like structure. We still don’t quite know what its purpose is though. Some have speculated that it’s a helmet, others that it plays a part in courtship. Australian pelican ( Pelecanus conspicillatus ) Size: up to 1.8m, 13kg An Australian pelican ( Pelecanus conspicillatus ). Image credit: Jonathan Steinbeck Pelicans are Australian icons (who could forget Mr Percival), dotting themselves across wharves and harbours in coastal Australian towns, plunging their bills into the water and capturing fish. They may not be as tall as the emu or the cassowary, but they’re still considered to be one of the heaviest flying birds in the world, weighing up to 13kg. And their bills are very intimidating. Often a pelican will crane its neck with it mouth agape, scaring off invaders . But Aussie pelicans weren’t and still aren’t always welcome at the local wharf. The species  was harvested for food by the Yandruwandha people in the Coongie Lakes, has long been persecuted and had nesting colonies destroyed by European fisher folk as perceived competitors for their fish stocks. What many Australians wouldn’t know about pelicans is that, every decade or so, some leave their coastal sanctuaries for the small, inland lakes of the harsh Aussie outback, which experts argue is for breeding and feeding purposes. Brolga ( Antigone rubicunda ) Size: up to 1.5m, 8kg Brolga ( Antigone rubicunda ). Image credit: shutterstock Our largest waterbird, the brolga, is the absolute dancing queen of Australia with its elaborate, ritualised moves . They can be seen bobbing their heads, bowing and strutting their stuff all over Australia. Sometimes, they even lean back, tilt their bill to the sky and let out a loud trumpet noise . The brolga is considered to be sacred by Aboriginal Australians. As the story goes, a dancer named brolga was transformed into a crane, but never quite gave up her moves. Now, the dance of the brolga is regularly performed at corroborees by different Aboriginal groups. The tall, proud figure of the dancing brolga is revered, so much so that in 1986 the Queensland Government made the brolga its official bird emblem and it also decorates the state’s coat of arms, alongside the red deer.

Search Button Classifying Chemical Reactions Publication Date Categories February 19, 2020 Activities , Chemistry , Chemistry Activities Writing and balancing chemical equations is an essential skill for chemistry students, who must learn to predict the products of a reaction when given only the reactants. This becomes much easier for students to do when they learn the pattern of 5 basic categories of chemical reactions: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, and combustion. Types of Chemical Reactions Synthesis reactions Two or more reactants combine to make 1 new product. Examples: C(s) + O 2 (g) + CO 2 (g) H 2 O(l) + SO 3 (g) + H 2 SO 4 (aq) Decomposition reactions A single reactant breaks down to form 2 or more products. Examples: H 2 CO 3 (aq) + H 2 O(l) + CO 2 (g) CaCO 3 (s) + CaO(s) + CO 2 (g) Single-replacement reactions A single element replaces a similar element of an adjacent reactant compound. Example: Zn(s) + CuSO 4 (aq) + ZnSO 4 (aq) + Cu(s) Double-replacement reactions Two ionic compounds exchange ions, producing 2 new ionic compounds. Examples: NaCl(aq) AgNO 3 (aq) + NaNO 3 (aq) + AgCl(s) HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) + NaCl(aq) + H 2 O(l) Combustion reactions A single element or compound combines with oxygen gas releasing energy. This rapid oxidation is called burning. Examples: C(s) + O 2 (g) + CO 2 (g) + energy 2Mg(s) + O 2 (g) + 2MgO(s) + energy Next Generation Science Standards * The activities described in this article address the following dimensions of the Next Generation Science Standards: HS-PS1-2. Construct and revise an explanation for the outcome of a simple chemical reaction based on the outermost electron states of atoms, trends in the periodic table, and knowledge of the patterns of chemical properties. Developing and Using Models Use a model to predict the relationships between systems or between components of a system. Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions Construct and revise an explanation based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from a variety of sources (including students’ own investigations, models, theories, simulations, peer review) and the assumption that theories and laws that describe the natural world operate today as they did in the past and will continue to do so in the future. PS1. B: Chemical Reactions The fact that atoms are conserved, together with knowledge of the chemical properties of the elements involved, can be used to describe and predict chemical reactions. Patterns Different patterns may be observed at each of the scales at which a system is studied and can provide evidence for causality in explanations of phenomena. Safety Note: Use safety glasses or goggles and be cautious with the burning splints and Bunsen burner. Follow all local and state recommendations for chemical disposal. Materials This activity is based on Carolina Chemonstrations®: Reaction Types Kit. This kit comes with the materials to perform the reactions described below and more. Each lab group requires the following items to perform all the activities. You may want to set up the activities at stations and have student teams rotate through them. If so, print the instructions onto a card for each station. Nail (3″ or longer) ½ tsp Yeast (in a labeled test tube) 20 mL Hydrogen Peroxide, 3% (in a labeled 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask) ½ Steel Wool Pad 3 Wooden Splints Evaporating Dish 1 tsp Baking Soda Test Tube Rack 15 mL CuSO4 Solution, 0.5 M (in a labeled test tube) Bunsen Burner 30 mL Vinegar (in a labeled 250-mL beaker) 1 mL (20 drops) Ethanol (in a labeled, stoppered test tube) Laboratory Thermometer Rubber Band Paper Towels 2 Test Tubes Procedure Synthesis Activity Measure room temperature and record: ____°C. Soak a steel wool pad in 30 mL of vinegar in a 250-mL beaker. Remove pad and squeeze the excess vinegar back into the beaker.The vinegar strips away the coating on the steel filaments, which are 96 to 98% iron. Wrap the pad around the thermometer bulb, secure it with a rubber band, and observe the temperature over 5 min. Record the final temperature of the steel wool: _____°C. Was there a temperature change? Describe any changes to the steel wool. ________________________________. Write a balanced equation for this reaction. Include heat as a reactant or product. Decomposition Activity Pour the yeast from the test tube into the flask containing the 20 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The yeast contains the enzyme catalase that decomposes hydrogen peroxide. What gas or gases could be produced? Review the table below for confirming 3 common gases. Insert a flaming splint into the flask held at a 45° angle. Is the test positive for hydrogen (see Fig. 1)? Insert a glowing splint into the flask. Is the test positive for oxygen (see Fig. 1)? Write a balanced equation for this decomposition reaction. Figure 1 Standard test for 3 common gases. Single-replacement activity Hold the test tube containing 0.5 M CuSO 4 solution at a 45° angle and insert the nail. Place the test tube in the test tube rack. What happens? If you use a plain iron nail, here is the reaction: Fe(s) + CuSO 4 (aq) + ______(aq) + ______(s) A galvanized nail (coated with Zn), undergoes a different reaction: Zn(s) + CuSO 4 (aq) +______(aq) + ______(s) Complete and balance both equations. Double-replacement activity Pour the baking soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate, NaHCO 3 ) from the spoon into the 250-mL beaker containing the vinegar (acetic acid, HC 2 H 3 O 2 ). Describe what happens. Complete and balance the equation below for this reaction: NaHCO 3 + HC 2 H 3 O 2 + ______(aq) + ______(aq) One of the products, carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ), immediately decomposes into water and a gas. Complete and balance this equation, and identify the gas with a flaming or glowing splint: H 2 CO 3 + H 2 O + ______(g) Combustion activity Pour the 1 mL of ethanol from the stoppered test tube into the evaporating dish. With a flaming splint, carefully ignite the ethanol in the dish. (This reaction occurs in your car’s engine if you use gasoline that contains ethanol.) Do not touch the dish until 5 min after the flame extinguishes. Complete and balance the equation for this reaction: C 2 H 5 OH(l) + O 2 (g) + ______(g) + ______(g) + energy The combustion reaction for a Bunsen burner uses methane (CH 4 ) or propane (C 3 H 8 ). Complete and balance these 2 reactions: CH 4 (g) + O 2 (g) +______(g) + ______(g) + energy C 3 H 8 (g) + O 2 (g) + ______(g) + ______(g) + energy Extension activities Have students use the metal activity series to predict whether a free metal will replace another metal ion in an ionic compound for single-replacement reactions. Have students use a digital camera to document examples of the 5 types of chemical reactions in their local communities. Then, they can share these examples with the class in a PowerPoint® presentation. As a way to illustrate the relevance of synthesis and single-replacement reactions, have students research corrosion reactions (e.g., the verdigris on the Statue of Liberty) and some of the ways of preventing corrosion on ships and pipelines.

CRISPR stands for C lustered R egularly I nterspaced S hort P alindromic R epeats. It is a component of bacterial immune systems that can cut DNA, and has been repurposed as a gene editing tool. It acts as a precise pair of molecular scissors that can cut a target DNA sequence, directed by a customizable guide. The system is made up of two key parts: a C RISPR- as sociated (Cas) nuclease, which binds and cuts DNA, and a guide RNA sequence (gRNA), which directs the Cas nuclease to its target. It was discovered in bacterial immune systems, where it cuts the DNA of invading viruses, called bacteriophage, and disables them. Once the molecular mechanism for its DNA-cleaving ability was discovered, it was quickly developed as a tool for editing genomes. CRISPR is important because it allows scientists to rewrite the genetic code in almost any organism. It is simpler, cheaper, and more precise than previous gene editing techniques. Moreover, it has a range of real-world applications, including curing genetic disease and creating drought-resistant crops. The History & Discovery Of CRISPR Today, CRISPR is well-known as a precise gene editing tool, but it took many years for scientists to figure out what it was and how to harness its potential. Let’s discuss the inventors of this gene editing tool, the scientists who championed this technology, and the history behind these breakthroughs. Who discovered CRISPR? Image credit: New York Times CRISPR was discovered by Dr. Jennifer Doudna (UC Berkeley, seen on right in image above) and Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens, Berlin, left). Their groundbreaking paper, revealing that the CRISPR-Cas9 bacterial immune system could be repurposed as a gene editing tool , was published in the journal Science in 2012. It wasn’t until 2020 - well after it had been adopted in labs around the world - that Doudna and Charpentier won the Nobel prize in Chemistry for their discovery, becoming the first all-female team to do so. Other significant contributors include Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who pioneered the use of CRISPR in eukaryotic cells and discovered novel Cas variants, George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was among the first to demonstrate its use in human cells, and biochemist Virginijus Siksnys at Vilnius University in Lithuania , who independently discovered the ability of CRISPR to edit genes in other organisms. For more information on these early pioneers, you can check out our blog about prominent CRISPR scientists . History of CRISPR While Doudna and Charpentier were the first to adapt CRISPR-Cas9 as a gene editing tool, the history goes back a little further than their 2012 publication. In 1993, Dr. Fransisco Mojica, a scientist at the University of Alicante in Spain, identified repetitive palindromic segments of DNA interspaced with other fragments of genetic material in bacterial genomes. Dr. Mojico gave these regions the name CRISPR, and proposed that they are a component of the bacterial immune system. In 2007, a team of scientists led by Dr. Philippe Horvath experimentally demonstrated Mojica’s theory . Since its adaptation by Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier, this versatile gene editing technology has progressed rapidly. It has been adapted for many different purposes, including RNA editing, base and prime editing, live imaging, and diagnostics. It has been used to edit DNA in a variety of organisms, including humans. In 2019, the first CRISPR clinical trials began , harvesting cells from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and editing them in vitro before infusing them back into the body - a method known as cell therapy. After the success of SCD cell therapy trials, a CRISPR treatment was injected directly into human patients for the first time in 2020 . This technique is known as gene therapy, and was used to treat hereditary blindness. Ready to get started using CRISPR?

One thing I know is that a Newton is the net force required to accelerate an object with a mass of 1kg at a rate of 1m/s 2 . Now here's one of my questions: if 1N = what I stated earlier, does 2N = the net force required to accelerate an object with a mass of 2 kg at a rate of 1m/s 2 , or, does 2N = the net force required to accelerate an object with a mass of 1kg at a rate of 2m/s 2 ? A Newton is also a unit of weight for the metric system. Right? Can someone please explain to me what a Newton is.

I mean, another way to think of the Newton is that it is the unit of \"force\". The force acting on something is in the same direction as its acceleration and is equal to the magnitude of its acceleration times the mass of the object.\"Weight\" is what we call \"the force due to gravity\" in general conversation. So, since weight is a force, that means that it would be described using Newtons. But it's not so much that \"force\" is a \"weight\" but rather \"weight\" is a \"force\". Sort of like how not all rectangles are squares but all squares are rectangles.

No difference? yes so F (Force in Newtons) = m (mass in kg) x a (acceleration in m/s 2 ) so m= 1 and a = 2 ... 1 x 2 = 2 m= 2 and a = 1 ... 2 x 1 = 2 just be wary of using the term weight instead of mass and underwstand the difference between the two understand what SHISHKABOB said in his post :) Dave Oct 22, 2012 #6 DrewD 528 28 Leoragon said: To clarify what you said, my examples are the same. No difference? There is a difference, in one case you are accelerating a 2kg mass and in the other, you are accelerating a 1kg mass, but they both require 2N. So the acceleration that you see if you apply 2N to an object will depend on the object's mass, but the mass times whatever that acceleration is will be 2N... by definition.

Weight is the force due to gravity and mass is the amount of matter in an object? And since weight is the force due to gravity, it is considered a force. And this force is measured in Newtons. Am I correct? Oct 22, 2012 #8 TheAbsoluTurk 98 2 Yes. Weight is the force on an object due to gravity. You can calculate an object's weight by multiplying its mass by the acceleration due to gravity (on our beautiful planet this is 9.8 m/s^2 at sea level) That means a 1 kg object weighs 9.8 N. This force is the force exerted on the Earth by the object. Last edited: Oct 22, 2012 Oct 23, 2012 #9 AJ Bentley 667 0 Don't try to explain any of this to the guys down at the Gym. They won't understand and it's guaranteed to get you a 'wedgie' Oct 24, 2012 #10 dannielwang 2 0 Sir Isaac Newton's second law gives the concept of force in the formula: F = ma. This is read as, force equals mass times acceleration. In standard international units (SI units) mass is given in kilograms (kg), acceleration is given in meters per second per second (m/s2), and force is given in Newtons (N). Abbreviated as N, a Newton is defined as the force required to accelerate 1 kilogram a meter per second squared; in empty space. This concept is expressed in equations of the form, N = kg*m/s2. If this were an actual problem, numerical values would precede the associated units. Such as, 8 N = 4kg * 2m/s2. A Newton is a vector unit that relates both the magnitude and direction in SI. We say the force of gravity is -9.81 m/s2. So the force of 3.6 ounces (~1/9.81 kg) at the Earth's surface is 1N down. We could also say this is -1 N up, they are equivalent. Centimeters, grams, and seconds (CGS) were replaced by the SI's use of kilograms, meters, and seconds (KMS). The CGS unit of force is a dyne (dyn); 1 N = 100 000 dyn.

    "html": "Analytical Method Validation, Verification and Transfer for Pharma | Mourne Training Services Skip to content Search Toggle Menu Search for: Submit TRAINING COURSE Validation, Verification & Transfer of Methods for Pharmaceutical Analysis This course will provide you with the requisite scientific knowledge and understanding of analytical method lifecycle management, which includes the activities of validation, verification, transfer, and post-approval changes which affect methods, to allow informed interpretation of current regulatory guidance, such as ICH Q2(R2), ICH Q14 and cGMP. Download Course Description Book Now Synopsis The data generated using analytical test methods is essential for many of the critical decisions made in the pharmaceutical industry. To be confident in the integrity of this data it is crucial that the methods are fit for purpose throughout their lifecycle. To demonstrate that a method is fit for purpose will require either a validation, verification or transfer study, depending on the source of the method in question. This course provides a detailed explanation of how these studies are performed, enabling a full understanding of method performance characteristics and associated statistics, and how they are applied to the techniques used for analysing drug related samples. Attendees are invited to bring along any real life examples that they would like advice on during the training. These may be discussed during group exercises, or, where intellectual property is an issue, privately with the trainer. Total learning time = 20 hours More about total learning time Learning Objectives On completion of this training course you will be able to: Understand the purpose of analytical method validation and the principles of analytical error and measurement uncertainty, and how they link to acceptance criteria. Define the performance characteristics evaluated during method lifecycle management studies, i.e., robustness, specificity/selectivity, range (including response and lower range limits), accuracy and precision. Generate a suitable protocol for analytical method lifecycle management studies (i.e., validation, verification, transfer, and post-approval changes), including practically relevant experiments and suitable acceptance criteria. Interpret the results of analytical method lifecycle management studies using appropriate statistics and statistical tools. Be able to perform risk assessments associated with analytical method lifecycle management studies. Is this the version of the course that I want? This course is available in two versions; choose from either the pharmaceutical analysis version (test methods used for small molecules) or the biopharmaceutical analysis version (test methods used for large molecules, typically derived from biological or biotechnology processes). The analytical techniques used to test traditional small molecule pharmaceuticals are typically different to those used for testing biopharmaceuticals, also known as biotherapeutics. Therefore, the key difference between the two versions of this course is that the examples and case studies used in the course are tailored to these different types of medicinal products. Additionally, since the typical acceptance criteria which is applied to each type differs, the most relevant guidance can be provided to attendees. More information to help you choose: Course Option 1: Pharmaceutical Analysis You are currently viewing this version of the course Suitable for small molecules Why Choose this Version? If the methods that you want to validate, verify or transfer are for traditional, small molecule (typically < ~2000 Daltons) pharmaceutical products, then this is the right version for you. It will also be applicable for the majority of testing methods for raw materials, and methods associated with cleaning validation. Includes (but is not limited to): Assay (of drug content or other components), e.g., RP-HPLC, GC Related substances including stability indicating methods, e.g., RP-HPLC Elemental impurities, e.g., ICP-MS, ICP-OES Residual solvents, e.g., GC Dissolution testing Low level impurity methods such as leachables and extractables, and potential gentoxic impurities, e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS Water content, e.g., KF Course Option 2: Biopharmaceutial Analysis Go to this version of the course Suitable for Large Molecules Why Choose this Version? If the methods that you want to validate, verify or transfer are for relatively large molecules (typically > ~2000 Daltons), most commonly biological or biotechnology derived products, also known as biopharmaceuticals or biotherapeutics, then this is the right version for you. It may also be applicable to methods used for advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs). Includes treatment of a variety of analytical techniques typically used for these types of molecules: Bioassays – this course will cover common sources of error in bioassays and thus provide an understanding of typical acceptance criteria. It will also provide general guidance on validation of these types of methods. However, the very detailed and complex statistics often used in these types of methods is beyond the scope of the course. Binding assays, e.g. ELISA Chromatography techniques, e.g., RP-HPLC, Size exclusion HPLC (SEC or GFC), ion exchange HPLC (IEX), HILIC, Affinity chromatography, Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC).

This course has been designed for anyone who is either new to LC-MS, or who wishes to expand their current knowledge and understanding about the technique as a whole. All aspects of the technology and system are covered - from an overview of a typical HPLC system and important considerations when combining this separation technique with detection by mass spectrometry, all the way through the various atmospheric ionization processes and the different mass analyzers that are available. The main focus is on fundamental concepts but important practical aspects and some basic troubleshooting will also be introduced. Session 1: We will begin the course with a general overview of LC-MS as an analysis technique, what the benefits are, and what sort of samples the technique is best suited to. We will then move on to a more in-depth look at the HPLC section of this hyphenated technique – concentrating on common parts that make up a typical HPLC system and how they work together to deliver successful chromatographic separations. The session will conclude with a comprehensive overview of the three predominant mechanisms for generating gas phase ions using atmospheric pressure ionization; atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), and electrospray ionization (ESI). We will discuss the similarities and differences between the methods, as well as which is best suited to the different sample types. Session 2: In this session we will consider the next section of the mass spectrometer, after the production of gas phase ions and their declustering in the interface, the mass analyzers. All of the most common mass analyzer types, from quadrupoles through to time-of-flight instruments to orbitraps will be included and will be discussed in detail. The different types of experimental data acquisitions (scan, SIM, SRM, and neutral loss) will also be explained, with reference to differences between triple quadrupoles, single quadrupole, and ion trap based instruments. Session 3: Session 3 returns to the HPLC side of this analysis method, with detailed discussions on the effects that various aspects of the LC separation may have on your MS data. We will include effects of solvent type and the common LC additives, for both ESI and APCI ionization – looking at their effect on ionization efficiency, desolvation, and adduct formation. In the second part of this session we take a look at other important components of typical mass spectrometers. We will briefly describe how the detector itself works, illustrating the importance of controlling how ions travel through the mass spectrometer. We will then discuss the vacuum system and the importance of this. Some general maintenance hints and tips will be included. Session 4: In session 4 we will concentrate on the data produced during typical LC-MS analyses and give an overview of data interpretation and structural elucidation from MS/MS data. The course concludes with a summary of the many parameters and considerations that require optimization to obtain the best possible data from your LC-MS analyses. Using the information from the earlier sessions we will assess factors such as optimizing the sprayer position and voltages, as well as the effects of eluent flow rates and pneumatic assistance. The session concludes with a summary of key guidelines to achieve the best LC-MS data with your samples.",

As an example, let us consider the distance traveled\nin a certain length of time by a car moving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour.\nWe can represent this relationship by 1.\tA word sentence: The distance traveled in miles is equal to forty times the number of hours traveled. 2.\tAn equation: d = 40r. 3.\tA tabulation of values. 4.\tA graph showing the relationship between time and distance. We have already used word sentences and equations to describe such relationships;\nin this chapter, we will deal with tabular and graphical representations. 7.1\tSOLVING EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES ORDERED PAIRS The equation d = 40f pairs a distance d for each time t. For example, if\tt = 1,\tthen\td = 40 if\tt = 2,\tthen\td = 80 if\tt = 3,\tthen\td = 120 and so on. The pair of numbers 1 and 40, considered together, is called a solution of the\nequation d = 40r because when we substitute 1 for t and 40 for d in the equation,\nwe get a true statement. If we agree to refer to the paired numbers in a specified\norder in which the first number refers to time and the second number refers to\ndistance, we can abbreviate the above solutions as (1, 40), (2, 80), (3, 120), and\nso on. We call such pairs of numbers ordered pairs, and we refer to the first and\nsecond numbers in the pairs as components. With this agreement, solutions of the\nequation d - 40t are ordered pairs (t, d) whose components satisfy the equation.\nSome ordered pairs for t equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are (0,0), (1,40), (2,80), (3,120), (4,160), and (5,200) Such pairings are sometimes shown in one of the following tabular forms. In any particular equation involving two variables, when we assign a value to one\nof the variables, the value for the other variable is determined and therefore\ndependent on the first. It is convenient to speak of the variable associated with the\nfirst component of an ordered pair as the independent variable and the variable\nassociated with the second component of an ordered pair as the dependent variable. If the variables x and y are used in an equation, it is understood that replace-\nments for x are first components and hence x is the independent variable and\nreplacements for y are second components and hence y is the dependent variable.\nFor example, we can obtain pairings for equation by substituting a particular value of one variable into Equation (1) and solving for\nthe other variable. Example 1 Find the missing component so that the ordered pair is a solution to 2x + y = 4 a. (0,?) b. (1,?) c. (2,?) Solution if\tx = 0,\tthen\t2(0) + y = 4 y = 4 if\tx = 1,\tthen\t2(1) + y = 4 y = 2 if\tx = 2,\tthen\t2(2) + y = 4 y = 0 The three pairings can now be displayed as the three ordered pairs (0,4),\t(1,2), and (2,0) or in the tabular forms EXPRESSING A VARIABLE EXPLICITLY We can add -2x to both members of 2x + y = 4 to get -2x + 2x + y = -2x + 4 y = -2x + 4 In Equation (2), where y is by itself, we say that y is expressed explicitly in terms\nof x. It is often easier to obtain solutions if equations are first expressed in such form\nbecause the dependent variable is expressed explicitly in terms of the independent\nvariable. For example, in Equation (2) above, if\tx = 0,\tthen\ty = -2(0)\t+ 4 = 4 if\tx = 1,\tthen\ty = -2(1)\t+ 4 = 2 if\tx = 2 \tthen\ty = -2(2)\t+ 4 = 0 We get the same pairings that we obtained using Equation (1) (0,4),\t(1,2), and (2,0) We obtained Equation (2) by adding the same quantity, -2x, to each member\nof Equation (1), in that way getting y by itself. In general, we can write equivalent\nequations in two variables by using the properties we introduced in Chapter 3,\nwhere we solved first-degree equations in one variable. Equations are equivalent if: The same quantity is added to or subtracted from equal quantities. Equal quantities are multiplied or divided by the same nonzero quantity. Example 2 Solve 2y - 3x = 4 explicitly for y in terms of x and obtain solutions for x = 0,\nx = 1, and x = 2. Solution First, adding 3x to each member we get 2y - 3x + 3x = 4 + 3x 2y = 4 + 3x\t(continued) Now, dividing each member by 2, we obtain In this form, we obtain values of y for given values of x as follows: In this case, three solutions are (0, 2), (1, 7/2), and (2, 5). FUNCTION NOTATION Sometimes, we use a special notation to name the second component of an ordered\npair that is paired with a specified first component. The symbol f(x), which is often\nused to name an algebraic expression in the variable x, can also be used to denote\nthe value of the expression for specific values of x. For example, if f(x) = -2x + 4 where f{x) is playing the same role as y in Equation (2) on page 285, then f(1)\nrepresents the value of the expression -2x + 4 when x is replaced by 1 f(l) = -2(1) + 4 = 2 Similarly, f(0) = -2(0) + 4 = 4 and f(2) = -2(2) + 4 = 0 The symbol f(x) is commonly referred to as function notation. Example 3 If f(x) = -3x + 2, find f(-2) and f(2). Solution Replace x with -2 to obtain f(-2) = -3(-2) + 2 = 8 Replace x with 2 to obtain f(2) = -3(2) + 2 = -4 7.2\tGRAPHS OF ORDERED PAIRS In Section 1.1, we saw that every number corresponds to a point in a line. Simi-\nlarly, every ordered pair of numbers (x, y) corresponds to a point in a plane. To\ngraph an ordered pair of numbers, we begin by constructing a pair of perpendicular\nnumber lines, called axes. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis, the vertical axis\nis called the y-axis, and their point of intersection is called the origin. These axes\ndivide the plane into four quadrants, as shown in Figure 7.1. Now we can assign an ordered pair of numbers to a point in the plane by referring\nto the perpendicular distance of the point from each of the axes. If the first\ncomponent is positive, the point lies to the right of the vertical axis; if negative, it\nlies to the left. If the second component is positive, the point lies above the\nhorizontal axis; if negative, it lies below. Example 1 Graph (3, 2), (-3, 2), (-3, -2), and (3, -2) on a rectangular coordinate system. Solution The graph of (3, 2) lies 3 units to the right of\nthe y-axis and 2 units above the x-axis;\nthe graph of (-3,2) lies 3 units to the left of the\ny-axis and 2 units above the x-axis;\nthe graph of (-3, -2) lies 3 units to the left of\nthe y-axis and 2 units below the x-axis;\nthe graph of (3, -2) lies 3 units to the right of\nthe y-axis and 2 units below the x-axis. The distance y that the point is located from the x-axis is called the ordinate\nof the point, and the distance x that the point is located from the y-axis is called\nthe abscissa of the point. The abscissa and ordinate together are called the rectan-\ngular or Cartesian coordinates of the point (see Figure 7.2). 7.3\tGRAPHING FIRST-DEGREE EQUATIONS In Section 7.1, we saw that a solution of an equation in two variables is an ordered\npair. In Section 7.2, we saw that the components of an ordered pair are the\ncoordinates of a point in a plane. Thus, to graph an equation in two variables, we\ngraph the set of ordered pairs that are solutions to the equation. For example, we\ncan find some solutions to the first-degree equation y = x + 2 by letting x equal 0, -3, -2, and 3. Then, for\tx = 0,\ty=0+2=2 for\tx = 0,\ty = -3 + 2 = -1 for\tx = -2,\ty = -2 + 2 - 0 for\tx = 3,\ty = 3 + 2 = 5 and we obtain the solutions (0,2), (-3,-1), (-2,0), and (3,5) which can be displayed in a tabular form as shown below. If we graph the points determined by these\nordered pairs and pass a straight line through\nthem, we obtain the graph of all solutions of\ny = x + 2, as shown in Figure 7.3. That is,\nevery solution of y = x + 2 lies on the line,\nand every point on the line is a solution of\ny = x + 2. The graphs of first-degree equations in two\nvariables are always straight lines; therefore,\nsuch equations are also referred to as linear\nequations. In the above example, the values we used for\nx were chosen at random; we could have used\nany values of x to find solutions to the equation.\nThe graphs of any other ordered pairs that are solutions of the equation would also\nbe on the line shown in Figure 7.3. In fact, each linear equation in two variables\nhas an infinite number of solutions whose graph lies on a line. However, we only\nneed to find two solutions because only two points are necessary to determine a\nstraight line. A third point can be obtained as a check. To graph a first-degree equation: Construct a set of rectangular axes showing the scale and the variable repre-\nsented by each axis. Find two ordered pairs that are solutions of the equation to be graphed by\nassigning any convenient value to one variable and determining the corre-\nsponding value of the other variable. Graph these ordered pairs. Draw a straight line through the points. Check by graphing a third ordered pair that is a solution of the equation and\nverify that it lies on the line. Example 1 Graph the equation y = 2x - 6. Solution We first select any two values of x to find the associated values of y. We will use 1 and 4 for x. If x = 1, y = 2(1) - 6 = -4 if x = 4, y = 2(4) - 6 = 2 Thus, two solutions of the equation are (1, -4) and (4, 2). Next, we graph these ordered pairs and draw a straight line through the points as shown\nin the figure. We use arrowheads to show that\nthe line extends infinitely far in both directions.\nAny third ordered pair that satisfies the\nequation can be used as a check: if x = 5, y = 2(5) -6 = 4 We then note that the graph of (5, 4) also lies on the line To find solutions to an equation, as we have noted it is often easiest to first solve\nexplicitly for y in terms of x. Example 2 Graph x + 2y = 4. Solution We first solve for y in terms of x to get We now select any two values of x to find the associated values of y. We will use\n2 and 0 for x. Thus, two solutions of the equation are (2, 1) and (0, 2). Next, we graph these ordered pairs and\npass a straight line through the points, as\nshown in the figure. Any third ordered pair that satisfies the\nequation can be used as a check: We then note that the graph of (-2, 3) also\nlies on the line. SPECIAL CASES OF LINEAR EQUATIONS The equation y = 2 can be written as 0x + y = 2 and can be considered a linear equation in two\nvariables where the coefficient of x is 0. Some\nsolutions of 0x + y = 2 are (1,2), (-1,2), and (4,2) In fact, any ordered pair of the form (x, 2) is\na solution of (1). Graphing the solutions\nyields a horizontal line as shown in Figure\n7.4. Similarly, an equation such as x = -3 can\nbe written as x + 0y = -3 and can be considered a linear equation in two\nvariables where the coefficient of y is 0. Some solutions of x + 0y = -3 are\n(-3, 5), (-3, 1), and (-3, -2). In fact, any\nordered pair of the form (-3, y) is a solution\nof (2). Graphing the solutions yields a vertical\nline as shown in Figure 7.5. Example 3 Graph a. y = 3 b. x=2 Solution a. We may write y = 3 as Ox + y =3. Some solutions are (1, 3), (2,3), and (5, 3). b. We may write x = 2 as x + Oy = 2. Some solutions are (2, 4), (2, 1), and (2, -2). 7.4 INTERCEPT METHOD OF GRAPHING In Section 7.3, we assigned values to x in equations in two variables to find the\ncorresponding values of y. The solutions of an equation in two variables that are\ngenerally easiest to find are those in which either the first or second component is\n0. For example, if we substitute 0 for x in the equation 3x + 4y = 12 we have 3(0) + 4y = 12 y = 3 Thus, a solution of Equation (1) is (0, 3). We can also find ordered pairs that are\nsolutions of equations in two variables by assigning values to y and determining the\ncorresponding values of x. In particular, if we substitute 0 for y in Equation (1), we\nget 3x + 4(0) = 12 x = 4 and a second solution of the equation is (4, 0). We can now use the ordered pairs\n(0, 3) and (4, 0) to graph Equation (1). The graph is shown in Figure 7.6. Notice\nthat the line crosses the x-axis at 4 and the y-axis at 3. For this reason, the number\n4 is called the x-intercept of the graph, and the number 3 is called the y-intercept. This method of drawing the graph of a linear equation is called the intercept\nmethod of graphing. Note that when we use this method of graphing a linear\nequation, there is no advantage in first expressing y explicitly in terms of x. Example 1 Graph 2x - y = 6 by the intercept method. Solution We find the x-intercept by substituting 0 for y in the equation to obtain 2x - (0) = 6 2x = 6 x = 3 Now, we find the y-intercept by substituting\nfor x in the equation to get 2(0) - y = 6 -y = 6 y = -6 The ordered pairs (3, 0) and (0, -6) are solutions of 2x - y = 6. Graphing these\npoints and connecting them with a straight line give us the graph of 2x - y = 6.\nIf the graph intersects the axes at or near the origin, the intercept method is not\nsatisfactory. We must then graph an ordered pair that is a solution of the equation\nand whose graph is not the origin or is not too close to the origin. Example 2 Graph y = 3x. Solution We can substitute 0 for x and find y = 3(0) = 0 Similarly, substituting 0 for y, we get 0 = 3.x, x = 0 Thus, 0 is both the x-intercept and the y-intercept. Since one point is not sufficient to graphy = 3x, we resort to the methods outlined in\nSection 7.3. Choosing any other value for x,say 2, we get y = 3(2) = 6 Thus, (0, 0) and (2, 6) are solutions to the\nequation. The graph of y = 3x is shown at the\nright. 7.5\tSLOPE OF A LINE SLOPE FORMULA In this section, we will study an important property of a line. We will assign a\nnumber to a line, which we call slope, that will give us a measure of the \"steepness\"\nor \"direction\" of the line. It is often convenient to use a special notation to distinguish between the rectan-\ngular coordinates of two different points. We can designate one pair of coordinates\nby (x 1 , y 1 (read \"x sub one, y sub one\"), associated with a point P 1 , and a second\npair of coordinates by (x 2 , y 2 ), associated with a second point P 2 , as shown in Figure\n7.7. Note in Figure 7.7 that when going from P 1 to P 2 , the vertical change (or\nvertical distance) between the two points is y 2 - y 1 and the horizontal change (or\nhorizontal distance) is x 2 - x 1 . The ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change is called the slope of the\nline containing the points P 1 and P 2 . This ratio is usually designated by m. Thus, Example 1 Find the slope of the line containing the two\npoints with coordinates (-4, 2) and (3, 5) as\nshown in the figure at the right. Solution We designate (3, 5) as (x 2 , y 2 ) and (-4, 2)\nas (x 1 , y 1 ). Substituting into Equation (1)\nyields Note that we get the same result if we subsitute -4 and 2 for x 2 and y 2 and 3 and\n5 for x 1 and y 1 Lines with various slopes are shown in Figure 7.8 below. Slopes of the lines that\ngo up to the right are positive (Figure 7.8a) and the slopes of lines that go down\nto the right are negative (Figure 7.8b). And note (Figure 7.8c) that because all\npoints on a horizontal line have the same y value, y 2 - y 1 equals zero for any two\npoints and the slope of the line is simply Also note (Figure 7.8c) that since all points on a vertical have the same x value,\nx 2 - x 1 equals zero for any two points. However, is undefined, so that a vertical line does not have a slope. PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES Consider the lines shown in Figure 7.9. Line l 1 has slope m 1 = 3, and line l 2 has\nslope m 2 = 3. In this case, These lines will never intersect and are called parallel lines. Now consider the lines\nshown in Figure 7.10. Line l 1 , has slope m 1 = 1/2 and line l 2 has slope m 2 = -2.\nIn this case, These lines meet to form a right angle and are called perpendicular lines. In general, if two lines have slopes and m2: a.\tThe lines are parallel if they have the same slope, that is,\nif m 1 = m 2 . b.\tThe lines are perpendicular If the product of their slopes\nis -1, that is, if m 1 * m 2 = -1. 7.6\tEQUATIONS OF STRAIGHT LINES POINT-SLOPE FORM In Section 7.5, we found the slope of a straight line by using the formula Let us say we know that a line goes through the point (2, 3) and has a slope of 2.\nIf we denote any other point on the line as P(x, y) (See Figure 7.1 la), by the slope\nformula Thus, Equation (1) is the equation of the line that goes through the point (2, 3) and\nhas a slope of 2. In general let us say we know a line passes through a point P 1 (x 1 , y 1 and has\nslope m. If we denote any other point on the line as P(x, y) (see Figure 7.11 b), by\nthe slope formula Equation (2) is called the point-slope form for a linear equation. In Equation (2),\nm, x 1 and y 1 are known and x and y are variables that represent the coordinates of\nany point on the line. Thus, whenever we know the slope of a line and a point on\nthe line, we can find the equation of the line by using Equation (2). Example 1 A line has slope -2 and passes through point (2, 4). Find the equation of the line. Solution Substitute -2 for m and (2, 4) for (x 1 , y 1 ) in Equation (2) Thus, a line with slope -2 that passes through the point (2, 4) has the equation\ny = -2x + 8. We could also write the equation in equivalent forms y + 2x = 8,\n2x + y = 8, or 2x + y - 8 = 0. SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM Now consider the equation of a line with slope m and y-intercept b as shown in\nFigure 7.12. Substituting 0 for x 1 and b for y 1 in the point-slope form of a linear\nequation, we have y - b = m(x - 0) y - b = mx or y = mx + b Equation (3) is called the slope-intercept form\nfor a linear equation. The slope and y-intercept\ncan be obtained directly from an equation in\nthis form. Example 2 If a line has the equation then the slope of the line must be -2 and the y-intercept must be 8. Similarly, the\ngraph of y = -3x + 4 has a slope -3 and a y-intercept 4; and the graph of has a slope 1/4 and a y-intercept -2. If an equation is not written in x = mx + b form and we want to know the slope\nand/or the y-intercept, we rewrite the equation by solving for y in terms of x. Example 3 Find the slope and y-intercept of 2x - 3y = 6. Solution We first solve for y in terms of x by adding -2x to each member. 2x - 3y - 2x = 6 - 2x - 3y = 6 - 2x Now dividing each member by -3, we have Comparing this equation with the form y = mx + b, we note that the slope m (the\ncoefficient of x) equals 2/3, and the y-intercept equals -2. 7.7\tDIRECT VARIATION A special case of a first-degree equation in two variables is given by y = kx (k is a constant) Such a relationship is called a direct variation. We say that the variable y varies\ndirectly as x. Example 1 We know that the pressure P in a liquid varies directly as the depth d below the\nsurface of the liquid. We can state this relationship in symbols as P = kd In a direct variation, if we know a set of conditions on the two variables, and if\nwe further know another value for one of the variables, we can find the value of\nthe second variable for this new set of conditions. In the above example, we can solve for the constant k to obtain Since the ratio P/d is constant for each set of conditions, we can use a proportion\nto solve problems involving direct variation. Example 2 If pressure P varies directly as depth d, and P = 40 when d = 10, find P when\nd = 15. Solution Since the ratio P/d is constant, we can substitute values for P and d and obtain the\nproportion Thus, P = 60 when d = 15. 7.8\tINEQUALITIES IN TWO VARIABLES In Sections 7.3 and 7.4, we graphed equations in two variables. In this section we\nwill graph inequalities in two variables. For example, consider the inequality y ≤ -x + 6 The solutions are ordered pairs of numbers that \"satisfy\" the inequality. That is,\n(a, b) is a solution of the inequality if the inequality is a true statement after we\nsubstitute a for x and b for y. Example 1 Determine if the given ordered pair is a solution of y = -x + 6. a. (1, 1) b. (2, 5) Solution The ordered pair (1, 1) is a solution because, when 1 is substituted for x and 1 is\nsubstituted for y, we get (1) = -(1) + 6, or 1 = 5 which is a true statement. On the other hand, (2, 5) is not a solution because when\n2 is substituted for x and 5 is substituted for y, we obtain (5)\t= -(2) + 6, or 5 = 4 which is a false statement. To graph the inequality y = -x + 6, we first graph the equation y = -x + 6\nshown in Figure 7.13. Notice that (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), and so on, associated\nwith the points that are on or below the line, are all solutions of the inequality\ny = -x + 6, whereas (3,4), (3, 5), and (3,6), associated with points above the\nline are not solutions of the inequality. In fact, all ordered pairs associated with\npoints on or below the line are solutions of y = - x + 6. Thus, every point on or\nbelow the line is in the graph. We represent this by shading the region below the\nline (see Figure 7.14). In general, to graph a first-degree inequality in two variables of the form\nAx + By = C or Ax + By = C, we first graph the equation Ax + By = C and\nthen determine which half-plane (a region above or below the line) contains the\nsolutions. We then shade this half-plane. We can always determine which half-\nplane to shade by selecting a point (not on the line of the equation Ax + By = C)\nand testing to see if the ordered pair associated with the point is a solution of the\ngiven inequality. If so, we shade the half-plane containing the test point; otherwise,\nwe shade the other half-plane. Often, (0, 0) is a convenient test point. Example 2 Graph 2x+3y = 6 Solution We first graph the line 2x + 3y = 6 (see graph a). Using the origin as a test point,\nwe determine whether (0, 0) is a solution of 2x + 3y ≥ 6. Since the statement 2(0) + 3(0) = 6 is false, (0, 0) is not a solution and we shade the half-plane that does not contain\nthe origin (see graph b). When the line Ax + By = C passes through the origin, (0, 0) is not a valid test\npoint since it is on the line. Example 3 Graph y = 2x. Solution We begin by graphing the line y = 2x (see graph a). Since the line passes through\nthe origin, we must choose another point not on the line as our test point. We will\nuse (0, 1). Since the statement (1) = 2(0) is true, (0, 1) is a solution and we shade the half-plane that contains (0, 1) (see\ngraph b). If the inequality symbol is '< or > , the points on the graph of Ax + By = C\nare not solutions of the inequality. We then use a dashed line for the graph of\nAx + By = C. CHAPTER SUMMARY A solution of an equation in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers. In the\nordered pair (x, y), x is called the first component and y is called the second\ncomponent. For an equation in two variables, the variable associated with the first\ncomponent of a solution is called the independent variable and the variable\nassociated with the second component is called the dependent variable.\nFunction notation f(x) is used to name an algebraic expression in x. When x in\nthe symbol f(x) is replaced by a particular value, the symbol represents the value\nof the expression for that value of x. The intersection of the two perpendicular axes in a coordinate systemis called the\norigin of the system, and each of the four regions into which the plane is divided\nis called a quadrant. The components of an ordered pair (x, y) associated with a\npoint in the plane are called the coordinates of the point; x is called the abscissa\nof the point and y is called the ordinate of the point. The graph of a first-degree equation in two variables is a straight line. That is, every\nordered pair that is a solution of the equation has a graph that lies in a line, and\nevery point in the line is associated with an ordered pair that is a solution of the\nequation. The graphs of any two solutions of an equation in two variables can be used to\nobtain the graph of the equation. However, the two solutions of an equation in two\nvariables that are generally easiest to find are those in which either the first or\nsecond component is 0. The x-coordinate of the point where a line crosses the x-axis\nis called the x-intercept of the line, and the y-coordinate of the point where a line\ncrosses the y-axis is called they-intercept of the line. Using the intercepts to graph\nan equation is called the intercept method of graphing. The slope of a line containing the points P 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) and P 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) is given by Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (m 1 = m 2 ). Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is - l(m 1 * m 2 = -1). The point-slope form of a line with slope m and passing through the point (x 1 , y 1 )\nis y - y 1 - m(x - x 1 ) The slope-intercept form of a line with slope m and y-intercept b is y = mx + b A relationship determined by an equation of the form y = kx (k a constant) is called a direct variation. A solution of an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that,\nwhen substituted into the inequality, makes the inequality a true statement. The\ngraph of a linear inequality in two variables is a half-plane.\nThe symbols introduced in this chapter appear on the inside front covers.

As an example, let us consider the distance traveled\nin a certain length of time by a car moving at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour.\nWe can represent this relationship by 1.\tA word sentence: The distance traveled in miles is equal to forty times the number of hours traveled. 2.\tAn equation: d = 40r. 3.\tA tabulation of values. 4.\tA graph showing the relationship between time and distance. We have already used word sentences and equations to describe such relationships;\nin this chapter, we will deal with tabular and graphical representations. 7.1\tSOLVING EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES ORDERED PAIRS The equation d = 40f pairs a distance d for each time t. For example, if\tt = 1,\tthen\td = 40 if\tt = 2,\tthen\td = 80 if\tt = 3,\tthen\td = 120 and so on. The pair of numbers 1 and 40, considered together, is called a solution of the\nequation d = 40r because when we substitute 1 for t and 40 for d in the equation,\nwe get a true statement. If we agree to refer to the paired numbers in a specified\norder in which the first number refers to time and the second number refers to\ndistance, we can abbreviate the above solutions as (1, 40), (2, 80), (3, 120), and\nso on. We call such pairs of numbers ordered pairs, and we refer to the first and\nsecond numbers in the pairs as components. With this agreement, solutions of the\nequation d - 40t are ordered pairs (t, d) whose components satisfy the equation.\nSome ordered pairs for t equal to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are (0,0), (1,40), (2,80), (3,120), (4,160), and (5,200) Such pairings are sometimes shown in one of the following tabular forms. In any particular equation involving two variables, when we assign a value to one\nof the variables, the value for the other variable is determined and therefore\ndependent on the first. It is convenient to speak of the variable associated with the\nfirst component of an ordered pair as the independent variable and the variable\nassociated with the second component of an ordered pair as the dependent variable. If the variables x and y are used in an equation, it is understood that replace-\nments for x are first components and hence x is the independent variable and\nreplacements for y are second components and hence y is the dependent variable.\nFor example, we can obtain pairings for equation by substituting a particular value of one variable into Equation (1) and solving for\nthe other variable. Example 1 Find the missing component so that the ordered pair is a solution to 2x + y = 4 a. (0,?) b. (1,?) c. (2,?) Solution if\tx = 0,\tthen\t2(0) + y = 4 y = 4 if\tx = 1,\tthen\t2(1) + y = 4 y = 2 if\tx = 2,\tthen\t2(2) + y = 4 y = 0 The three pairings can now be displayed as the three ordered pairs (0,4),\t(1,2), and (2,0) or in the tabular forms EXPRESSING A VARIABLE EXPLICITLY We can add -2x to both members of 2x + y = 4 to get -2x + 2x + y = -2x + 4 y = -2x + 4 In Equation (2), where y is by itself, we say that y is expressed explicitly in terms\nof x. It is often easier to obtain solutions if equations are first expressed in such form\nbecause the dependent variable is expressed explicitly in terms of the independent\nvariable. For example, in Equation (2) above, if\tx = 0,\tthen\ty = -2(0)\t+ 4 = 4 if\tx = 1,\tthen\ty = -2(1)\t+ 4 = 2 if\tx = 2 \tthen\ty = -2(2)\t+ 4 = 0 We get the same pairings that we obtained using Equation (1) (0,4),\t(1,2), and (2,0) We obtained Equation (2) by adding the same quantity, -2x, to each member\nof Equation (1), in that way getting y by itself. In general, we can write equivalent\nequations in two variables by using the properties we introduced in Chapter 3,\nwhere we solved first-degree equations in one variable. Equations are equivalent if: The same quantity is added to or subtracted from equal quantities. Equal quantities are multiplied or divided by the same nonzero quantity. Example 2 Solve 2y - 3x = 4 explicitly for y in terms of x and obtain solutions for x = 0,\nx = 1, and x = 2. Solution First, adding 3x to each member we get 2y - 3x + 3x = 4 + 3x 2y = 4 + 3x\t(continued) Now, dividing each member by 2, we obtain In this form, we obtain values of y for given values of x as follows: In this case, three solutions are (0, 2), (1, 7/2), and (2, 5). FUNCTION NOTATION Sometimes, we use a special notation to name the second component of an ordered\npair that is paired with a specified first component. The symbol f(x), which is often\nused to name an algebraic expression in the variable x, can also be used to denote\nthe value of the expression for specific values of x. For example, if f(x) = -2x + 4 where f{x) is playing the same role as y in Equation (2) on page 285, then f(1)\nrepresents the value of the expression -2x + 4 when x is replaced by 1 f(l) = -2(1) + 4 = 2 Similarly, f(0) = -2(0) + 4 = 4 and f(2) = -2(2) + 4 = 0 The symbol f(x) is commonly referred to as function notation. Example 3 If f(x) = -3x + 2, find f(-2) and f(2). Solution Replace x with -2 to obtain f(-2) = -3(-2) + 2 = 8 Replace x with 2 to obtain f(2) = -3(2) + 2 = -4 7.2\tGRAPHS OF ORDERED PAIRS In Section 1.1, we saw that every number corresponds to a point in a line. Simi-\nlarly, every ordered pair of numbers (x, y) corresponds to a point in a plane. To\ngraph an ordered pair of numbers, we begin by constructing a pair of perpendicular\nnumber lines, called axes. The horizontal axis is called the x-axis, the vertical axis\nis called the y-axis, and their point of intersection is called the origin. These axes\ndivide the plane into four quadrants, as shown in Figure 7.1. Now we can assign an ordered pair of numbers to a point in the plane by referring\nto the perpendicular distance of the point from each of the axes. If the first\ncomponent is positive, the point lies to the right of the vertical axis; if negative, it\nlies to the left. If the second component is positive, the point lies above the\nhorizontal axis; if negative, it lies below. Example 1 Graph (3, 2), (-3, 2), (-3, -2), and (3, -2) on a rectangular coordinate system. Solution The graph of (3, 2) lies 3 units to the right of\nthe y-axis and 2 units above the x-axis;\nthe graph of (-3,2) lies 3 units to the left of the\ny-axis and 2 units above the x-axis;\nthe graph of (-3, -2) lies 3 units to the left of\nthe y-axis and 2 units below the x-axis;\nthe graph of (3, -2) lies 3 units to the right of\nthe y-axis and 2 units below the x-axis. The distance y that the point is located from the x-axis is called the ordinate\nof the point, and the distance x that the point is located from the y-axis is called\nthe abscissa of the point. The abscissa and ordinate together are called the rectan-\ngular or Cartesian coordinates of the point (see Figure 7.2). 7.3\tGRAPHING FIRST-DEGREE EQUATIONS In Section 7.1, we saw that a solution of an equation in two variables is an ordered\npair. In Section 7.2, we saw that the components of an ordered pair are the\ncoordinates of a point in a plane. Thus, to graph an equation in two variables, we\ngraph the set of ordered pairs that are solutions to the equation. For example, we\ncan find some solutions to the first-degree equation y = x + 2 by letting x equal 0, -3, -2, and 3. Then, for\tx = 0,\ty=0+2=2 for\tx = 0,\ty = -3 + 2 = -1 for\tx = -2,\ty = -2 + 2 - 0 for\tx = 3,\ty = 3 + 2 = 5 and we obtain the solutions (0,2), (-3,-1), (-2,0), and (3,5) which can be displayed in a tabular form as shown below. If we graph the points determined by these\nordered pairs and pass a straight line through\nthem, we obtain the graph of all solutions of\ny = x + 2, as shown in Figure 7.3. That is,\nevery solution of y = x + 2 lies on the line,\nand every point on the line is a solution of\ny = x + 2. The graphs of first-degree equations in two\nvariables are always straight lines; therefore,\nsuch equations are also referred to as linear\nequations. In the above example, the values we used for\nx were chosen at random; we could have used\nany values of x to find solutions to the equation.\nThe graphs of any other ordered pairs that are solutions of the equation would also\nbe on the line shown in Figure 7.3. In fact, each linear equation in two variables\nhas an infinite number of solutions whose graph lies on a line. However, we only\nneed to find two solutions because only two points are necessary to determine a\nstraight line. A third point can be obtained as a check. To graph a first-degree equation: Construct a set of rectangular axes showing the scale and the variable repre-\nsented by each axis. Find two ordered pairs that are solutions of the equation to be graphed by\nassigning any convenient value to one variable and determining the corre-\nsponding value of the other variable. Graph these ordered pairs. Draw a straight line through the points. Check by graphing a third ordered pair that is a solution of the equation and\nverify that it lies on the line. Example 1 Graph the equation y = 2x - 6. Solution We first select any two values of x to find the associated values of y. We will use 1 and 4 for x. If x = 1, y = 2(1) - 6 = -4 if x = 4, y = 2(4) - 6 = 2 Thus, two solutions of the equation are (1, -4) and (4, 2). Next, we graph these ordered pairs and draw a straight line through the points as shown\nin the figure. We use arrowheads to show that\nthe line extends infinitely far in both directions.\nAny third ordered pair that satisfies the\nequation can be used as a check: if x = 5, y = 2(5) -6 = 4 We then note that the graph of (5, 4) also lies on the line To find solutions to an equation, as we have noted it is often easiest to first solve\nexplicitly for y in terms of x. Example 2 Graph x + 2y = 4. Solution We first solve for y in terms of x to get We now select any two values of x to find the associated values of y. We will use\n2 and 0 for x. Thus, two solutions of the equation are (2, 1) and (0, 2). Next, we graph these ordered pairs and\npass a straight line through the points, as\nshown in the figure. Any third ordered pair that satisfies the\nequation can be used as a check: We then note that the graph of (-2, 3) also\nlies on the line. SPECIAL CASES OF LINEAR EQUATIONS The equation y = 2 can be written as 0x + y = 2 and can be considered a linear equation in two\nvariables where the coefficient of x is 0. Some\nsolutions of 0x + y = 2 are (1,2), (-1,2), and (4,2) In fact, any ordered pair of the form (x, 2) is\na solution of (1). Graphing the solutions\nyields a horizontal line as shown in Figure\n7.4. Similarly, an equation such as x = -3 can\nbe written as x + 0y = -3 and can be considered a linear equation in two\nvariables where the coefficient of y is 0. Some solutions of x + 0y = -3 are\n(-3, 5), (-3, 1), and (-3, -2). In fact, any\nordered pair of the form (-3, y) is a solution\nof (2). Graphing the solutions yields a vertical\nline as shown in Figure 7.5. Example 3 Graph a. y = 3 b. x=2 Solution a. We may write y = 3 as Ox + y =3. Some solutions are (1, 3), (2,3), and (5, 3). b. We may write x = 2 as x + Oy = 2. Some solutions are (2, 4), (2, 1), and (2, -2). 7.4 INTERCEPT METHOD OF GRAPHING In Section 7.3, we assigned values to x in equations in two variables to find the\ncorresponding values of y. The solutions of an equation in two variables that are\ngenerally easiest to find are those in which either the first or second component is\n0. For example, if we substitute 0 for x in the equation 3x + 4y = 12 we have 3(0) + 4y = 12 y = 3 Thus, a solution of Equation (1) is (0, 3). We can also find ordered pairs that are\nsolutions of equations in two variables by assigning values to y and determining the\ncorresponding values of x. In particular, if we substitute 0 for y in Equation (1), we\nget 3x + 4(0) = 12 x = 4 and a second solution of the equation is (4, 0). We can now use the ordered pairs\n(0, 3) and (4, 0) to graph Equation (1). The graph is shown in Figure 7.6. Notice\nthat the line crosses the x-axis at 4 and the y-axis at 3. For this reason, the number\n4 is called the x-intercept of the graph, and the number 3 is called the y-intercept. This method of drawing the graph of a linear equation is called the intercept\nmethod of graphing. Note that when we use this method of graphing a linear\nequation, there is no advantage in first expressing y explicitly in terms of x. Example 1 Graph 2x - y = 6 by the intercept method. Solution We find the x-intercept by substituting 0 for y in the equation to obtain 2x - (0) = 6 2x = 6 x = 3 Now, we find the y-intercept by substituting\nfor x in the equation to get 2(0) - y = 6 -y = 6 y = -6 The ordered pairs (3, 0) and (0, -6) are solutions of 2x - y = 6. Graphing these\npoints and connecting them with a straight line give us the graph of 2x - y = 6.\nIf the graph intersects the axes at or near the origin, the intercept method is not\nsatisfactory. We must then graph an ordered pair that is a solution of the equation\nand whose graph is not the origin or is not too close to the origin. Example 2 Graph y = 3x. Solution We can substitute 0 for x and find y = 3(0) = 0 Similarly, substituting 0 for y, we get 0 = 3.x, x = 0 Thus, 0 is both the x-intercept and the y-intercept. Since one point is not sufficient to graphy = 3x, we resort to the methods outlined in\nSection 7.3. Choosing any other value for x,say 2, we get y = 3(2) = 6 Thus, (0, 0) and (2, 6) are solutions to the\nequation. The graph of y = 3x is shown at the\nright. 7.5\tSLOPE OF A LINE SLOPE FORMULA In this section, we will study an important property of a line. We will assign a\nnumber to a line, which we call slope, that will give us a measure of the \"steepness\"\nor \"direction\" of the line. It is often convenient to use a special notation to distinguish between the rectan-\ngular coordinates of two different points. We can designate one pair of coordinates\nby (x 1 , y 1 (read \"x sub one, y sub one\"), associated with a point P 1 , and a second\npair of coordinates by (x 2 , y 2 ), associated with a second point P 2 , as shown in Figure\n7.7. Note in Figure 7.7 that when going from P 1 to P 2 , the vertical change (or\nvertical distance) between the two points is y 2 - y 1 and the horizontal change (or\nhorizontal distance) is x 2 - x 1 . The ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change is called the slope of the\nline containing the points P 1 and P 2 . This ratio is usually designated by m. Thus, Example 1 Find the slope of the line containing the two\npoints with coordinates (-4, 2) and (3, 5) as\nshown in the figure at the right. Solution We designate (3, 5) as (x 2 , y 2 ) and (-4, 2)\nas (x 1 , y 1 ). Substituting into Equation (1)\nyields Note that we get the same result if we subsitute -4 and 2 for x 2 and y 2 and 3 and\n5 for x 1 and y 1 Lines with various slopes are shown in Figure 7.8 below. Slopes of the lines that\ngo up to the right are positive (Figure 7.8a) and the slopes of lines that go down\nto the right are negative (Figure 7.8b). And note (Figure 7.8c) that because all\npoints on a horizontal line have the same y value, y 2 - y 1 equals zero for any two\npoints and the slope of the line is simply Also note (Figure 7.8c) that since all points on a vertical have the same x value,\nx 2 - x 1 equals zero for any two points. However, is undefined, so that a vertical line does not have a slope. PARALLEL AND PERPENDICULAR LINES Consider the lines shown in Figure 7.9. Line l 1 has slope m 1 = 3, and line l 2 has\nslope m 2 = 3. In this case, These lines will never intersect and are called parallel lines. Now consider the lines\nshown in Figure 7.10. Line l 1 , has slope m 1 = 1/2 and line l 2 has slope m 2 = -2.\nIn this case, These lines meet to form a right angle and are called perpendicular lines. In general, if two lines have slopes and m2: a.\tThe lines are parallel if they have the same slope, that is,\nif m 1 = m 2 . b.\tThe lines are perpendicular If the product of their slopes\nis -1, that is, if m 1 * m 2 = -1. 7.6\tEQUATIONS OF STRAIGHT LINES POINT-SLOPE FORM In Section 7.5, we found the slope of a straight line by using the formula Let us say we know that a line goes through the point (2, 3) and has a slope of 2.\nIf we denote any other point on the line as P(x, y) (See Figure 7.1 la), by the slope\nformula Thus, Equation (1) is the equation of the line that goes through the point (2, 3) and\nhas a slope of 2. In general let us say we know a line passes through a point P 1 (x 1 , y 1 and has\nslope m. If we denote any other point on the line as P(x, y) (see Figure 7.11 b), by\nthe slope formula Equation (2) is called the point-slope form for a linear equation. In Equation (2),\nm, x 1 and y 1 are known and x and y are variables that represent the coordinates of\nany point on the line. Thus, whenever we know the slope of a line and a point on\nthe line, we can find the equation of the line by using Equation (2). Example 1 A line has slope -2 and passes through point (2, 4). Find the equation of the line. Solution Substitute -2 for m and (2, 4) for (x 1 , y 1 ) in Equation (2) Thus, a line with slope -2 that passes through the point (2, 4) has the equation\ny = -2x + 8. We could also write the equation in equivalent forms y + 2x = 8,\n2x + y = 8, or 2x + y - 8 = 0. SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM Now consider the equation of a line with slope m and y-intercept b as shown in\nFigure 7.12. Substituting 0 for x 1 and b for y 1 in the point-slope form of a linear\nequation, we have y - b = m(x - 0) y - b = mx or y = mx + b Equation (3) is called the slope-intercept form\nfor a linear equation. The slope and y-intercept\ncan be obtained directly from an equation in\nthis form. Example 2 If a line has the equation then the slope of the line must be -2 and the y-intercept must be 8. Similarly, the\ngraph of y = -3x + 4 has a slope -3 and a y-intercept 4; and the graph of has a slope 1/4 and a y-intercept -2. If an equation is not written in x = mx + b form and we want to know the slope\nand/or the y-intercept, we rewrite the equation by solving for y in terms of x. Example 3 Find the slope and y-intercept of 2x - 3y = 6. Solution We first solve for y in terms of x by adding -2x to each member. 2x - 3y - 2x = 6 - 2x - 3y = 6 - 2x Now dividing each member by -3, we have Comparing this equation with the form y = mx + b, we note that the slope m (the\ncoefficient of x) equals 2/3, and the y-intercept equals -2. 7.7\tDIRECT VARIATION A special case of a first-degree equation in two variables is given by y = kx (k is a constant) Such a relationship is called a direct variation. We say that the variable y varies\ndirectly as x. Example 1 We know that the pressure P in a liquid varies directly as the depth d below the\nsurface of the liquid. We can state this relationship in symbols as P = kd In a direct variation, if we know a set of conditions on the two variables, and if\nwe further know another value for one of the variables, we can find the value of\nthe second variable for this new set of conditions. In the above example, we can solve for the constant k to obtain Since the ratio P/d is constant for each set of conditions, we can use a proportion\nto solve problems involving direct variation. Example 2 If pressure P varies directly as depth d, and P = 40 when d = 10, find P when\nd = 15. Solution Since the ratio P/d is constant, we can substitute values for P and d and obtain the\nproportion Thus, P = 60 when d = 15. 7.8\tINEQUALITIES IN TWO VARIABLES In Sections 7.3 and 7.4, we graphed equations in two variables. In this section we\nwill graph inequalities in two variables. For example, consider the inequality y ≤ -x + 6 The solutions are ordered pairs of numbers that \"satisfy\" the inequality. That is,\n(a, b) is a solution of the inequality if the inequality is a true statement after we\nsubstitute a for x and b for y. Example 1 Determine if the given ordered pair is a solution of y = -x + 6. a. (1, 1) b. (2, 5) Solution The ordered pair (1, 1) is a solution because, when 1 is substituted for x and 1 is\nsubstituted for y, we get (1) = -(1) + 6, or 1 = 5 which is a true statement. On the other hand, (2, 5) is not a solution because when\n2 is substituted for x and 5 is substituted for y, we obtain (5)\t= -(2) + 6, or 5 = 4 which is a false statement. To graph the inequality y = -x + 6, we first graph the equation y = -x + 6\nshown in Figure 7.13. Notice that (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), and so on, associated\nwith the points that are on or below the line, are all solutions of the inequality\ny = -x + 6, whereas (3,4), (3, 5), and (3,6), associated with points above the\nline are not solutions of the inequality. In fact, all ordered pairs associated with\npoints on or below the line are solutions of y = - x + 6. Thus, every point on or\nbelow the line is in the graph. We represent this by shading the region below the\nline (see Figure 7.14). In general, to graph a first-degree inequality in two variables of the form\nAx + By = C or Ax + By = C, we first graph the equation Ax + By = C and\nthen determine which half-plane (a region above or below the line) contains the\nsolutions. We then shade this half-plane. We can always determine which half-\nplane to shade by selecting a point (not on the line of the equation Ax + By = C)\nand testing to see if the ordered pair associated with the point is a solution of the\ngiven inequality. If so, we shade the half-plane containing the test point; otherwise,\nwe shade the other half-plane. Often, (0, 0) is a convenient test point. Example 2 Graph 2x+3y = 6 Solution We first graph the line 2x + 3y = 6 (see graph a). Using the origin as a test point,\nwe determine whether (0, 0) is a solution of 2x + 3y ≥ 6. Since the statement 2(0) + 3(0) = 6 is false, (0, 0) is not a solution and we shade the half-plane that does not contain\nthe origin (see graph b). When the line Ax + By = C passes through the origin, (0, 0) is not a valid test\npoint since it is on the line. Example 3 Graph y = 2x. Solution We begin by graphing the line y = 2x (see graph a). Since the line passes through\nthe origin, we must choose another point not on the line as our test point. We will\nuse (0, 1). Since the statement (1) = 2(0) is true, (0, 1) is a solution and we shade the half-plane that contains (0, 1) (see\ngraph b). If the inequality symbol is '< or > , the points on the graph of Ax + By = C\nare not solutions of the inequality. We then use a dashed line for the graph of\nAx + By = C. CHAPTER SUMMARY A solution of an equation in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers. In the\nordered pair (x, y), x is called the first component and y is called the second\ncomponent. For an equation in two variables, the variable associated with the first\ncomponent of a solution is called the independent variable and the variable\nassociated with the second component is called the dependent variable.\nFunction notation f(x) is used to name an algebraic expression in x. When x in\nthe symbol f(x) is replaced by a particular value, the symbol represents the value\nof the expression for that value of x. The intersection of the two perpendicular axes in a coordinate systemis called the\norigin of the system, and each of the four regions into which the plane is divided\nis called a quadrant. The components of an ordered pair (x, y) associated with a\npoint in the plane are called the coordinates of the point; x is called the abscissa\nof the point and y is called the ordinate of the point. The graph of a first-degree equation in two variables is a straight line. That is, every\nordered pair that is a solution of the equation has a graph that lies in a line, and\nevery point in the line is associated with an ordered pair that is a solution of the\nequation. The graphs of any two solutions of an equation in two variables can be used to\nobtain the graph of the equation. However, the two solutions of an equation in two\nvariables that are generally easiest to find are those in which either the first or\nsecond component is 0. The x-coordinate of the point where a line crosses the x-axis\nis called the x-intercept of the line, and the y-coordinate of the point where a line\ncrosses the y-axis is called they-intercept of the line. Using the intercepts to graph\nan equation is called the intercept method of graphing. The slope of a line containing the points P 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) and P 2 (x 2 , y 2 ) is given by Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope (m 1 = m 2 ). Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is - l(m 1 * m 2 = -1). The point-slope form of a line with slope m and passing through the point (x 1 , y 1 )\nis y - y 1 - m(x - x 1 ) The slope-intercept form of a line with slope m and y-intercept b is y = mx + b A relationship determined by an equation of the form y = kx (k a constant) is called a direct variation. A solution of an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair of numbers that,\nwhen substituted into the inequality, makes the inequality a true statement. The\ngraph of a linear inequality in two variables is a half-plane.\nThe symbols introduced in this chapter appear on the inside front covers.

(easy) Determine the electric potential at 0.001 m from a charge of 2pC. V = kq/r V = 9x10 9 (2x10 -12 )/(0.001) = 18 volts 2. (easy) Refer to the scenario in question #1. a. If a second charge (-2pC) was the same distance from the point of interest as the first charge, find the total electric potential at that point. The total potential is the algebraic sum of the potential caused by each charge: V = Σkq/r Since the distances are the same for each charge, but the sign is opposite, the total potential is zero in this case. b. If the second charge was closer to the point of interest would the total potential be positive of negative? Since the negative charge would be closer than the positive charge, the total potential would be negative. 3. (easy) Is the magnitude of the electric potential caused by point charges an absolute or a relative value. Explain your answer. Electric potential is based on electric potential energy. The magnitude of the electric potential energy is relative to an established frame of reference. A convenient F.O.R. is usually utilized wherein a system of two charges separated by infinite distance has a potential energy of zero. Mathematically it can be shown that the electric potential infinitely far from a charge is zero when using the same F.O.R.. 4. (moderate) Two charges are located on corners of a rectangle with a height of 0.05 m and a width of 0.15 m. The first charge (q 1 = -5x10 -6 C) is located at the upper left hand corner, while the second charge (q 2 = +2.0 x10 -6 C) is at the lower right hand corner. Determine the electric potential at the upper right hand corner of the rectangle. V = Σ(kq/r) V = k[(-5x10 -6 /0.15) + (2x10 -6 /0.05)] V = 60000 volts 5. (moderate) What is the potential difference for a point at the right hand corner (call it point A) of the rectangle in question #2 relative to the lower left hand corner (call it point B)? V A = 60000 volts V B = k[(-5x10 -6 /0.05) + (2x10 -6 /0.15)] = -780000 volts ΔV = V A – V B = 60000 - (-780000) = 840000 volts 6. (moderate) Two charged particles are placed on the x axis of a coordinate system. The first (q 1 = 2x10 -6 C) is at the origin. The second (q 2 = -5x10 -6 C) is at x = 1.0 m. Determine a point in between these two charges where the electric potential is zero. Let x be the distance from q 1 to the point of zero potential: V = Σ(kq/r) = 0 0 = k[(2x10 -6 /x) – (5x10 -6 /(1 – x))] 18000/x = 45000/(1 – x) x = 0.29 m 7. (moderate) Two charged particles are held in place on the x-axis of a coordinate system. Charge q 1 (5 C) is at the origin. Charge q 2 (3 C) is at x = 1 m. A relatively small positive test charge (q = 0.01 C, m = 0.001 kg) is released from rest at x = 0.5 m. Will the test charge move to the right or the left? Additionally, use the concepts of electric potential and electric potential energy to determine the speed of the test particle after it moves 0.1 m. The test particle is repelled from both charges. It begins to move toward the 3C charge because the net force is in that direction. To find the speed at x = 0.6 m, which is 0.1 m to the right of the initial position, we need to determine the change in K. The change in K is the opposite of the change in U. The change in U is related to the charge and the voltage. V = k(q 1 /r 1 + q 2 /r 2 ) ΔV = k[(5/0.6 + 3/0.4) - (5/0.5 + 3/0.5)] ΔV = k(5.8) = -1.5x10 9 volts ΔU = qΔV ΔU = (0.01)(-1.5x10 9 ) = -1.5x10 7 J ΔK = -ΔU = 1.5x10 7 J ΔK = K 2 – K 1 = K 2 – 0 1.5x10 7 = K 2 = ½mv 2 1.5x10 7 = ½(0.001)v 2 v = 173205 m/s *The \"AP\" designation is a registered trademark of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, products sold on this website.

(easy) Determine the electric potential at 0.001 m from a charge of 2pC. V = kq/r V = 9x10 9 (2x10 -12 )/(0.001) = 18 volts 2. (easy) Refer to the scenario in question #1. a. If a second charge (-2pC) was the same distance from the point of interest as the first charge, find the total electric potential at that point. The total potential is the algebraic sum of the potential caused by each charge: V = Σkq/r Since the distances are the same for each charge, but the sign is opposite, the total potential is zero in this case. b. If the second charge was closer to the point of interest would the total potential be positive of negative? Since the negative charge would be closer than the positive charge, the total potential would be negative. 3. (easy) Is the magnitude of the electric potential caused by point charges an absolute or a relative value. Explain your answer. Electric potential is based on electric potential energy. The magnitude of the electric potential energy is relative to an established frame of reference. A convenient F.O.R. is usually utilized wherein a system of two charges separated by infinite distance has a potential energy of zero. Mathematically it can be shown that the electric potential infinitely far from a charge is zero when using the same F.O.R.. 4. (moderate) Two charges are located on corners of a rectangle with a height of 0.05 m and a width of 0.15 m. The first charge (q 1 = -5x10 -6 C) is located at the upper left hand corner, while the second charge (q 2 = +2.0 x10 -6 C) is at the lower right hand corner. Determine the electric potential at the upper right hand corner of the rectangle. V = Σ(kq/r) V = k[(-5x10 -6 /0.15) + (2x10 -6 /0.05)] V = 60000 volts 5. (moderate) What is the potential difference for a point at the right hand corner (call it point A) of the rectangle in question #2 relative to the lower left hand corner (call it point B)? V A = 60000 volts V B = k[(-5x10 -6 /0.05) + (2x10 -6 /0.15)] = -780000 volts ΔV = V A – V B = 60000 - (-780000) = 840000 volts 6. (moderate) Two charged particles are placed on the x axis of a coordinate system. The first (q 1 = 2x10 -6 C) is at the origin. The second (q 2 = -5x10 -6 C) is at x = 1.0 m. Determine a point in between these two charges where the electric potential is zero. Let x be the distance from q 1 to the point of zero potential: V = Σ(kq/r) = 0 0 = k[(2x10 -6 /x) – (5x10 -6 /(1 – x))] 18000/x = 45000/(1 – x) x = 0.29 m 7. (moderate) Two charged particles are held in place on the x-axis of a coordinate system. Charge q 1 (5 C) is at the origin. Charge q 2 (3 C) is at x = 1 m.

This \ncollision leads to a variety of dramatic geological events, including \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains and deep\n ocean trenches. Convergent Boundary At convergent boundaries, plates move towards each other. Often, one plate slides beneath the other in a process known as subduction . The subducting plate sinks into the Earth's mantle, where intense heat and pressure cause it to melt. This molten rock, or magma, can then rise to the surface, fueling volcanic eruptions. The Cascade Range in the western United States and the Andes Mountains in South America are prime examples of volcanic mountain ranges formed by this process. When two continental plates collide , the outcome is different. Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct easily. Instead, the immense force of the collision crumples and buckles the crust, pushing it upwards to form towering mountain ranges like the Himalayas . The immense forces at play at convergent boundaries make them highly active seismic zones. The grinding and shifting of tectonic plates trigger earthquakes, and the vast majority (around 80%) of the world's earthquakes occur along these boundaries. These boundaries are not only destructive but also crucial in shaping Earth's dynamic landscape. The specific type of convergent boundary, defined by the colliding crusts (oceanic or continental) , plays a significant role in the characteristics of the resulting earthquakes and tsunamis. Convergent Boundaries: Examples & Types Convergent Boundary Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence At an oceanic-oceanic convergent boundary, two oceanic plates with distinct densities collide. Due to its greater density, typically associated with older and cooler characteristics, one plate subducts beneath the other. Subduction signifies the descent of a denser oceanic plate into the mantle due to gravitational forces. The subducting plate encounters elevated temperatures and pressures within the mantle. This extreme environment can induce the breakdown of hydrous minerals trapped within the subducting plate, releasing water. The introduction of water lowers the melting point of the surrounding mantle, facilitating the generation of magma. This buoyant magma ascends through the overriding plate, eventually reaching the surface and erupting to form a linear sequence of volcanic islands, termed a volcanic arc. The Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean and the associated Mariana island chain exemplify this type of convergent boundary. Key features: Island arcs, deep ocean trenches, active volcanoes. Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence Oceanic-Continental Convergence An oceanic-continental convergent boundary is characterized by the collision of a denser oceanic plate with a less dense continental plate. As anticipated, owing to its higher density, the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate. Similar to oceanic-oceanic convergence, the subduction zone generates heat that can cause the subducting plate to melt and trigger the release of water trapped within the minerals. However, in oceanic-continental convergence, the released water plays a particularly critical role. The rising water vapor can significantly reduce the melting point of the mantle rock above the subduction zone, leading to the generation of even greater volumes of magma. This buoyant magma subsequently rises and erupts, forming a mountain range along the continental margin. Key features: Accretionary wedge, volcanic arc, mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches on the ocean side. Accretionary Wedge: As the oceanic plate scrapes against the continental margin, sediments and other debris accumulate, forming a wedge-shaped mass on the continental side. Volcanic Arc: The subducted plate releases water into the mantle, triggering partial melting and the formation of magma. This magma rises and erupts as volcanoes, forming a chain along the continental margin. The Andes Mountains and the Cascade Range in North America are examples of such volcanic arcs. Mountain Building : The ongoing subduction and collision over millions of years can lead to the thickening and uplifting of the continental crust, resulting in mountain range formation. The Andes Mountains in South America are a prime example of a mountain range formed by oceanic-continental convergence. Oceanic-Continental Convergence Continental-Continental Convergence Continental-continental convergence presents a distinct scenario compared to the previous two. When two continental plates collide, a process of subduction is not feasible due to the relatively low densities of both continental crusts. Consequently, the immense forces exerted during the collision cause the continental crust to crumple and elevate upwards. This large-scale deformation ultimately leads to the formation of colossal mountain ranges. Key features: Very high mountain ranges , plateaus, extensive faulting and folding . Mountain Building: The tremendous pressure from the collision pushes the continental masses upwards, leading to the formation of towering mountain ranges. The Himalayas , formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, are the world's highest mountain range due to continental-continental convergence. Plateau Uplift: The collision can also cause extensive areas of continental crust to be uplifted and form high plateaus, like the Tibetan Plateau. Deformation: The immense forces can cause extensive faulting, folding, and deformation of the continental rocks. Continental-Continental Convergence Subduction Zones Subduction zones are a specific type of \nconvergent boundary where one tectonic plate dives beneath another. This subduction is caused by the density differences between the plates. Oceanic crust is denser than continental crust because it is older and cooler. Therefore, when an oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, the oceanic plate will always be subducted beneath the \ncontinental plate. There are three primary types of convergent boundaries, categorized based on the interacting tectonic plate compositions, type of crust (oceanic or continental), that meets at the boundary\" The subduction process creates several geological features: Oceanic trenches: As the oceanic plate bends downward into the mantle, it forms a deep trench in the ocean floor. Accretionary wedge: Scraped off sediment and rock from the subducting oceanic plate pile up along the trench, forming a wedge-shaped mass called an accretionary wedge. Volcanic arc: As the subducted oceanic plate descends into the mantle, it carries water with it. This water lowers the melting point of the mantle rock, causing it to rise as magma. The magma eventually erupts to form a chain of volcanoes on the overriding plate, known as a volcanic arc. The Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped region around the Pacific Ocean, is home to many of Earth's most active volcanoes, all of which are located at subduction zones. A diagram illustrating an oceanic-continental convergent boundary, showing the process of subduction and the formation of a deep-sea trench. Oceanic Trenches Oceanic trenches are long, narrow depressions that mark the deepest parts of the ocean floor. They form at convergent boundaries where tectonic plates meet, and one plate subducts beneath the other. The subducting plate, which is usually denser oceanic crust, bends downward into the mantle, creating a deep trench. Depth: Oceanic trenches can reach incredible depths, with the deepest point being the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, which plunges to 11,034 meters (36,200 ft) below sea level. Location: Trenches are found along convergent plate boundaries, where tectonic plates collide. They are most commonly found around the Pacific Ocean in a region known as the Ring of Fire. Convergent Boundaries Examples Here's a breakdown of each example highlighting the type of convergent boundary and the key features formed: Map of convergent boundaries shown as blue lines Collision between the Eurasian Plate and the Indian Plate forming the Himalayas: This is a classic example of continental-continental convergence. The immense force of the collision has resulted in the formation of the world's highest mountain range, the Himalayas. Collision between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate forming the Southern Alps in New Zealand: Similar to the Himalayas, this is another example of continental-continental convergence leading to the creation of the Southern Alps. Subduction of the northern Pacific Plate and the NW North American Plate forming the Aleutian Islands: This is an example of oceanic-oceanic convergence. The subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate has formed the deep trenches and volcanic island arc of the Aleutian Islands. Subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate to form the Andes: This is a textbook example of oceanic-continental convergence. The subduction of the Nazca Plate has created the deep Peru-Chile Trench on the ocean side and the volcanic Andes Mountains on the continental side. Subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Australian Plate and Tonga Plate, forming the complex New Zealand to New Guinea subduction/transform boundaries: This region showcases a complex tectonic setting with both subduction and transform boundaries. The subduction of the Pacific Plate is responsible for the trenches and volcanic activity in parts of New Zealand. Collision of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate formed the Pontic Mountains in Turkey: This is another instance of continental-continental convergence. The collision of these plates has resulted in the formation of the Pontic Mountains. Subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Mariana Plate formed the Mariana Trench: This is an example of oceanic-oceanic convergence. The subduction of the denser Pacific Plate beneath the Mariana Plate has created the deepest oceanic trench on Earth - the Mariana Trench. Subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate to form the Cascade Range: This is another example of oceanic-continental convergence. The subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate has resulted in the formation of the Cascade Range, a chain of volcanoes on the western coast of North America. These examples showcase the diverse geological features that can be formed at convergent boundaries depending on the type of plates involved and the dynamics of the collision or subduction process. Conclusion Convergent boundaries epitomize the intricate interplay of tectonic forces that sculpt the Earth's lithosphere. Through the collision of tectonic plates, these zones engender diverse geological phenomena, ranging from volcanic arcs and mountain ranges to deep oceanic trenches. Appreciating the mechanisms and consequences of plate convergence elucidates fundamental aspects of Earth's dynamic processes, underscored by the pervasive influence of tectonic activity on terrestrial landscapes and seismicity.

This \ncollision leads to a variety of dramatic geological events, including \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the formation of mountains and deep\n ocean trenches. Convergent Boundary At convergent boundaries, plates move towards each other. Often, one plate slides beneath the other in a process known as subduction . The subducting plate sinks into the Earth's mantle, where intense heat and pressure cause it to melt. This molten rock, or magma, can then rise to the surface, fueling volcanic eruptions. The Cascade Range in the western United States and the Andes Mountains in South America are prime examples of volcanic mountain ranges formed by this process. When two continental plates collide , the outcome is different. Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct easily. Instead, the immense force of the collision crumples and buckles the crust, pushing it upwards to form towering mountain ranges like the Himalayas . The immense forces at play at convergent boundaries make them highly active seismic zones. The grinding and shifting of tectonic plates trigger earthquakes, and the vast majority (around 80%) of the world's earthquakes occur along these boundaries. These boundaries are not only destructive but also crucial in shaping Earth's dynamic landscape. The specific type of convergent boundary, defined by the colliding crusts (oceanic or continental) , plays a significant role in the characteristics of the resulting earthquakes and tsunamis. Convergent Boundaries: Examples & Types Convergent Boundary Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence At an oceanic-oceanic convergent boundary, two oceanic plates with distinct densities collide. Due to its greater density, typically associated with older and cooler characteristics, one plate subducts beneath the other. Subduction signifies the descent of a denser oceanic plate into the mantle due to gravitational forces. The subducting plate encounters elevated temperatures and pressures within the mantle. This extreme environment can induce the breakdown of hydrous minerals trapped within the subducting plate, releasing water. The introduction of water lowers the melting point of the surrounding mantle, facilitating the generation of magma. This buoyant magma ascends through the overriding plate, eventually reaching the surface and erupting to form a linear sequence of volcanic islands, termed a volcanic arc. The Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean and the associated Mariana island chain exemplify this type of convergent boundary. Key features: Island arcs, deep ocean trenches, active volcanoes. Oceanic-Oceanic Convergence Oceanic-Continental Convergence An oceanic-continental convergent boundary is characterized by the collision of a denser oceanic plate with a less dense continental plate. As anticipated, owing to its higher density, the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate. Similar to oceanic-oceanic convergence, the subduction zone generates heat that can cause the subducting plate to melt and trigger the release of water trapped within the minerals. However, in oceanic-continental convergence, the released water plays a particularly critical role. The rising water vapor can significantly reduce the melting point of the mantle rock above the subduction zone, leading to the generation of even greater volumes of magma. This buoyant magma subsequently rises and erupts, forming a mountain range along the continental margin. Key features: Accretionary wedge, volcanic arc, mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches on the ocean side. Accretionary Wedge: As the oceanic plate scrapes against the continental margin, sediments and other debris accumulate, forming a wedge-shaped mass on the continental side. Volcanic Arc: The subducted plate releases water into the mantle, triggering partial melting and the formation of magma. This magma rises and erupts as volcanoes, forming a chain along the continental margin. The Andes Mountains and the Cascade Range in North America are examples of such volcanic arcs. Mountain Building : The ongoing subduction and collision over millions of years can lead to the thickening and uplifting of the continental crust, resulting in mountain range formation.

Why can't we see this movement in the red figure? Curve studied by Bowditch in 1815 and by Lissajous in 1857. Other names: Lissajous figure. Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838): American mathematician\nand sailor. Jules Lissajous (1822-1880): French physicist. Reduced Cartesian parametrization: ( ). The Lissajous curves are the trajectories of a point the\ncomponents of which have a sinusoidal movement. The Lissajous curves of parameter n (ratio between\nthe frequencies of the two sinusoidal movements) are the projections on\nthe planes passing by the axis of the cylindric\nsine waves of parameter n : as well as of the cylindric sine waves of parameter 1/ n : . The curve whose reduced parametrization is in the header\nis indeed the projection on xOy of the cylindric sine wave of axis Oy and parameter n and the projection on xOy of the cylindric sine wave of axis Ox and parameter 1/ n . If n is irrational, then the curve is dense in\nthe rectangle .

Burke, MD Article Investigators tested six different methods for delivering hot air to the scalps of 169 children infested with lice to determine how well each method kills lice and their eggs. The children, who were at least 6 years of age, were treated at home and each subject served as his or her own control. This is how it worked: Investigators combed one side of the scalp, removing all lice and eggs, and preserved them in a portable incubator. Next, they treated the whole scalp with one of the six methods, then combed the other side of the scalp and again preserved all lice and eggs. In this way, investigators could compare the percentage of viable lice and eggs removed from the pretreatment and posttreatment sides of the scalp. The six methods for heating the scalp of infested children included using a bonnet-style hair dryer, a handheld blow dryer (using two different methods of sectioning the hair), a wall-mounted dryer, and a custom-built, high-volume hot-air blower called the LouseBuster, which was tested in two ways: with hair sectioning and with a custom-designed hand piece with teeth that facilitate exposure of the hair's roots to hot air. Each treatment took about 30 minutes. All six methods successfully killed a high percentage of louse eggs (> 88%) but varied considerably in how well they dispensed with hatched lice. The LouseBuster with hand piece had the best results, nearly 100% egg mortality and 80% hatched lice mortality. Furthermore, the device was effective when operated at a slightly cooler temperature than a standard blow dryer, and few children found it uncomfortable. Finally, follow-up examinations of the children one week after treatment with this method showed that 10 of the 11 were completely cured of lice-and the 11th had just one live male louse (Goates BM et al: Pediatrics 2006;118:1962). Imagine what would happen if the LouseBuster was kept in schools for use by school nurses, staff, or trained volunteers. Children with lice could be diagnosed, treated, and returned to class. Hot air: a cool idea that could eliminate the millions of school days lost to head lice.

Burke, MD Article Investigators tested six different methods for delivering hot air to the scalps of 169 children infested with lice to determine how well each method kills lice and their eggs. The children, who were at least 6 years of age, were treated at home and each subject served as his or her own control. This is how it worked: Investigators combed one side of the scalp, removing all lice and eggs, and preserved them in a portable incubator. Next, they treated the whole scalp with one of the six methods, then combed the other side of the scalp and again preserved all lice and eggs. In this way, investigators could compare the percentage of viable lice and eggs removed from the pretreatment and posttreatment sides of the scalp. The six methods for heating the scalp of infested children included using a bonnet-style hair dryer, a handheld blow dryer (using two different methods of sectioning the hair), a wall-mounted dryer, and a custom-built, high-volume hot-air blower called the LouseBuster, which was tested in two ways: with hair sectioning and with a custom-designed hand piece with teeth that facilitate exposure of the hair's roots to hot air. Each treatment took about 30 minutes. All six methods successfully killed a high percentage of louse eggs (> 88%) but varied considerably in how well they dispensed with hatched lice. The LouseBuster with hand piece had the best results, nearly 100% egg mortality and 80% hatched lice mortality. Furthermore, the device was effective when operated at a slightly cooler temperature than a standard blow dryer, and few children found it uncomfortable. Finally, follow-up examinations of the children one week after treatment with this method showed that 10 of the 11 were completely cured of lice-and the 11th had just one live male louse (Goates BM et al: Pediatrics 2006;118:1962).

Home Resources Application Notes What are Dehydrogenases and Their Examples? Loading... What are Dehydrogenases and Their Examples? Dehydrogenases are a class of oxidoreductases, constituting class EC 1 of the IUBMB classification of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which catalyze the removal of hydrogen atoms (protons and electrons) from substrate molecules. This process is called dehydrogenation. These hydrogen atoms are often transferred to a coenzyme molecule, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which serve as electron carriers. The reduced forms of these coenzymes, NADH and FADH 2 , can then donate the electrons they've gained to the electron transport chain in cellular respiration, ultimately leading to the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's primary energy currency. Function of Dehydrogenase Dehydrogenase can regulate the ratio of intracellular reducing cofactors (NADH) to oxidizing cofactors (NAD + ), maintaining cellular redox balance. ATP is generated during the dehydrogenation process, making dehydrogenases instrumental in energy production. Dehydrogenases are involved in various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), β-oxidation of fatty acids, and the breakdown of amino acids. Furthermore, the use of oxidoreductases (EC 1) for chemical synthesis is gaining increasing attention. Oxidoreductases, such as dehydrogenases, participate in enzymatic reactions and can selectively perform various biotransformations for the industrial synthesis of valuable chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. Dehydrogenases are involved in the biosynthesis of molecules like amino acids, lipids , and nucleotides . For instance, the dehydrogenase FrsC is involved in the biosynthesis of the selective Gq protein inhibitor FR900359. FrsC enzyme belongs to the lactate/malate dehydrogenase superfamily and has been shown to catalyze the formation of L-phenyllactate (PLA), with its stereoisomer D-PLA being a component of the non-ribosomal cyclic depsipeptide FR900359. Fig. 1. Specialized dehydrogenase used in biosynthesis (Klöppel, 2022). Dehydrogenase Reaction Dehydrogenases oxidize substrates by transferring hydrogen to electron acceptors, where the substrates either lose hydrogen atoms or gain oxygen atoms (from water). Both dehydrogenases and oxidases remove electrons from substrates. However, the key difference is that the former typically use NAD + or FAD as their electron acceptors, while the latter solely rely on oxygen as their electron acceptor. Dehydrogenase reactions commonly take two forms: Proton release: Dehydrogenases catalyze reactions by extracting two electrons from the substrate, reducing the acceptor. When alcohols are substrates, they release a proton, and the free electrons on oxygen are used to form a double bond. AH + B + ↔A + + BH Transfer of two hydrogens: Dehydrogenases use FAD as an electron acceptor to transfer two hydrogens, typically forming a double bond between the two hydrogen-receiving atoms. AH 2 + B ↔A + BH 2 Examples of Dehydrogenase Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) LDH is a zinc-containing metalloprotein, which is an enzyme involved in glycolysis and one of the crucial metabolic enzymes in the tumor microenvironment. LDH is composed of two distinct subunits, LDHA and LDHB, forming a tetramer. LDH is widely distributed in the body and is present in the cytoplasm of nearly all tissue cells. LDH mediates the bidirectional conversion between pyruvate and lactate and plays a significant role in regulating energy metabolism in tumor cells. Elevated LDH levels are used for the diagnosis and prognosis analysis of related cancers. 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex, which play a role in regulating the biosynthesis and metabolism of sugars, fats, and proteins. 11β-HSD is a metabolic enzyme for glucocorticoids, catalyzing the conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, thereby increasing the local tissue levels of glucocorticoids. Inhibiting the overexpression of 11β-HSD1 can reduce glucocorticoid activity, thus controlling blood sugar. Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) ADH is the primary enzyme responsible for ethanol metabolism in mammals. Alcohol is broken down by ADH in the body into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is further metabolized into acetic acid by ALDH2. During this process, the intermediate product, acetaldehyde, is biologically toxic. Aldehyde Dehydrogenases (ALDH) ALDH catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of substances like acetaldehyde. ALDH is highly efficient in catalyzing the oxidation of retinaldehyde, which is crucial for regulating tissue cell differentiation. ALDH is abnormally active in cancer stem cells of various cancers such as leukemia, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer, making it a marker for poor prognosis. Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) DHODH is a specialized mitochondrial enzyme known for its ability to generate essential components for DNA synthesis through oxidizing dihydroorotate simultaneously reducing coenzyme Q10 . DHODH is described as a novel iron death inhibitor, and potent and selective inhibitors like brequinar can sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a regulated oxidative cell death process, and inducing regulated cell death in the form of ferroptosis may represent a novel cancer therapy. Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) IDH is a critical metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It is also one of the most frequently mutated tumor metabolic genes in acute myeloidleukemia (AML). Mutations in IDH result in the catalysis of α-ketoglutarate to the enantiomerically distinct oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) while consuming NADPH to produce NADP + . Deformity inhibitors targeting IDH mutations effectively inhibit the activity of mutant IDH and the production of the oncogenic metabolite R-2HG, thereby exerting therapeutic effects.

Ozempic is a drug used to treat diabetes; now, millions of people are using it to lose weight. We talked to bariatric surgeon and Chief of Minimal Access/Bariatric Surgery Marc Bessler, MD, about how drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro work, the differences between medical and surgical treatment for obesity, risks, benefits, and all the questions in between. Key Takeaways: There is a positive impact of Ozempic and similar drugs Drugs like Ozempic may help shift societal perceptions in understanding obesity as a disease, from blame to medical treatment. Previously, effective medical treatments for obesity were limited, with most medications offering modest weight loss. Ozempic and similar drugs now yield an average weight loss of 15 to 20 percent, significantly higher than previous options. About one-third experience around 10 percent loss of body weight. Challenges and limitations of medical obesity treatment remain Treatment with drugs like Ozempic requires life-long commitment, as discontinuing the medication often leads to weight regain. Patients may face side effects, including nausea, reflux, abdominal cramping, delayed gastric emptying, and constipation, which might affect their ability or willingness to continue treatment. The high cost of medications like Ozempic, approximately $1,200 a month, poses a financial barrier for many individuals, potentially limiting access to this treatment option. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective treatment for severe obesity, but treatment will likely evolve to include a new combination of approaches in the future Ozempic, Mounjaro, and other drugs are not a solution for those who need to lose a significant amount of weight. The future of obesity treatment may involve a combination of drugs targeting multiple hormones, similar to managing conditions like diabetes or hypertension. Greater Weight Loss for More People There are still a lot of wrong assumptions about medical obesity, and a lot of blame. It is often not seen as a disease. That can make it harder for patients to seek treatment. Is it reasonable to say that Ozempic and similar drugs are having a positive impact on how medical obesity is addressed? Yes. It's opened up people's eyes to obesity as a disease now that there's effective medication for it. The vast majority of obese patients never got effective treatment because there wasn't effective treatment, or the treatment had more significant side effects. There was nothing that caused dramatic weight loss. You could get 5 to 10 percent of your weight loss on some of these other medications. Now we're looking at averages of 15 to 20 percent. You have Ozempic and Wegovy, which is just a double dose of Ozempic. Same drug, just marketed under a different name, and actually has FDA approval for weight loss indication, whereas Ozempic doesn't. Then Mounjaro, which is a different drug from a different company that actually not only has GLP-1 agonist effects, but also GIP gastrointestinal polypeptide, which delays stomach emptying a little bit and has been shown to be more effective for weight loss. It's only approved for weight loss, not diabetes. There's also Rybelsus, which is the oral version of Ozempic, not quite as effective, but a pill. And there will be other drugs coming out at some point. Wow. So there's good reason to be optimistic that many more people with medical obesity might achieve positive outcomes because of these drugs. I'd say when you average losing 20 percent of your starting weight—and no drug has 20 percent as the average, Mounjaro is a little under that, about 17 percent–that leaves half of patients doing really well, right? They're losing 20 percent and more, with a percentage losing up to 30 percent. But then you have your third of patients on the lower end of the scale who are only losing in the 10 percent range, and they'll say 90 percent of patients lost at least 10 percent of their weight. But if you're 250 pounds, that's 25 pounds. It's nice, but it's not going to get you the 60, 70 pounds that you would get with bariatric surgery . Though bariatric surgery was only available to about 2 percent of the population that was eligible for it. The other 98 percent basically had no effective treatment. It's big. It's a change we’ve not had in obesity care since sleeve gastrectomy started in 2007. Does that mean for the vast majority of people, these drugs can’t have lasting effects, and put obesity into remission? I think obesity is with you forever. If you have bariatric surgery and your obesity is in remission, does that mean you don't have the disease? I think you do. It's just the symptom of your disease, which is the excess weight that has been managed, treated, whatever you want to call it, by the operation. Same thing with the drug. So maybe if enough people are on these drugs with enough effect, you could start seeing a decrease in the number of patients with the weight qualification to now meet that diagnosis if they were going to be a new patient. I could definitely imagine that. But how many people would have to be on the drug to really change it? 30 percent of the US population is obese. That's 100 million people. I don't know how many people are on these drugs, but my guess is there are only a few million on it. Has there been an uptick of people who are seeking treatment, opening up to the conversation about how to treat their medical obesity? We will be offering primary medical obesity treatment with medications this fall. Previously, we have been mostly prescribing it for our patients who either need significant weight loss before surgery or those who are post-surgery and struggling, either not having lost enough or gaining back weight. So we've been using these drugs but, for the most part, not as primary treatment. We're seeing easily 25 percent of patients who are coming in for surgery have tried and failed or don't want to stay on these medications. Either they took it and had bad side effects or took it and didn't lose much weight. Or, “I took it, I lost a bunch of weight, but I don't want to stay on it.” It's not about the weight loss, it's about the maintenance. The majority of patients stop taking it. And then there's this thing about \"I'll stop; if I gain the weight back, I'll go back on it.\" Which is not so crazy, but if you're diabetic, you're not going to stop your insulin and then watch your sugar go up and go back on it when your sugar comes down. That's a more immediate thing. You don't do the same thing with blood pressure, \"Well, I'll come off my blood pressure meds or cholesterol meds, and see how I do.” So people would need to take these drugs for the rest of their lives? Yes. There's still this mindset, “Once I get this under control, I'll be able to keep it under control,” because it's not really a disease. They're willing to look at it a little bit more, but not fully understanding that this really isn't in your control. If it was in your control, it wouldn't be a disease, and you wouldn't be here. Like once I get there, whatever there is, everything will be different. It might be a little bit easier to exercise, but you won't like it more. It might be that you'll feel better, but feeling better doesn't make you eat less. And the hunger response to that weight loss is really what makes the weight come back. And these medications are pretty effective at reducing hunger. What about side effects? They also cause reflux. They also cause nausea. They also cause abdominal cramping. A very small percentage of patients get pancreatitis, that's one of the major side effects. Nausea, delayed gastric emptying. Constipation is pretty common too. Does bariatric surgery have any similar side effects? Bariatric surgery doesn't have nausea. Gastric bypass doesn't have reflux. A little bit of constipation, but not significant. Some patients have sleeve gastrectomy, where they get bad reflux. They might have to take antacid medications, which is a pill a day. Are some people stopping treatment with Ozempic because of these side effects? With Ozempic, nausea is the biggest thing for patients. It's the most common reason for stopping. Some have a lot of discomfort from reflux. And some just didn't lose that much weight. I have patients who didn't lose 30 percent of their starting weight and are not having symptoms and come to surgery. I have a patient for whom I did a lap band ; she lost a bunch of weight, but then decided she wanted to lose more and went on Mounjaro and got down to the weight she really wanted to reach. She had like 20 more pounds to lose, so it's relatively easy to get there with these medications. Bariatric Surgery vs. Medical Weight Loss: Similarities and Differences These are pretty incredible results, but will bariatric surgery always have more significant outcomes? When somebody's 350 pounds, they are not getting down to a weight that's healthy with medication. They might lose 50, but they're still going to be 300. I saw a patient recently who went from 320 pounds to 180 pounds on Mounjaro but got so badly constipated they ended up in the emergency room needing to be disimpacted. After that, they said, I'm done with these meds, and I'm going to have surgery so that I don't gain this weight back. It runs the whole gamut, from people not losing enough weight to having too many symptoms, to being thrilled. And then it's medication for life. So, if it's covered by insurance because you're diabetic or maybe because you're morbidly obese, and they cover it, that's great. You still must inject weekly for life as of right now. There will eventually be either longer-acting meds or pills that are as good as the injections. In what ways do these medications overlap with or mimic aspects of bariatric surgery? Basically, these drugs were discovered from some of the research we did on how gastric bypass works. We discovered that gastric bypass releases many hormones from the gut shortly after a meal that usually comes way later after you've eaten. In gastric bypass or sleeve, you get a blast of GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide 1, a hormone produced in the gut that releases insulin and reduces hunger] once you start eating. It's there in a balanced way, so you don't have the nausea because it's not there all the time. As opposed to having GLP-1 around all the time, which is what these meds do. That's a big part of how these operations work. You also get the release of other hormones along with GLP-1. It's more physiologic as opposed to having this drug that's in you all the time, that you don't really need in you all the time. Now I've had patients who had gastric bypass and gained weight back, then went on these meds, and that's what they needed. It was more GLP-1 than they were getting from the bypass, and it led to weight loss again. But as soon as they stop it, that weight returns because it's the same thing. If the drug isn't there, the disease is. What is the basic BMI [Body Mass Index] threshold to determine treatment? A BMI of 27 is overweight, BMI over 30 is obese. We're probably not going to treat anybody below 30 in our practice, and we're probably not going to treat anybody below 35 if they don't have medical problems. Usually, the insurance company would want you to have a BMI and a comorbid illness, whether it is high cholesterol, diabetes, sleep apnea, or hypertension. You can't just be ‘fat’ and have a BMI of 30. Is cost a factor? How much do these drugs cost? Ozempic costs about $1,200 a month, depending on the dose. There are some of these compounding pharmacies that do a generic version of it for a lot less money. I'm not so sure how comfortable we are with that. But what I do know is that people are taking the ‘generic,’ and it's not really generic; it's compounded. They're saying it's a different drug because it's compounded to get with some vitamins or something like that, but it's unregulated. And generally, people are not good about taking medications. We know that adherence to a medical regimen is not great. So as soon as you lose some weight and see you’re not losing weight anymore, a large percentage stop taking it. I wonder what's going to happen with insurance companies once they stop taking it, whether their insurance companies are going to allow them to go back on it. The bottom line is: will they go back on it? I don't know yet how this will work out on the medical versus surgical end. In the treatment of obesity, there was basically nothing decent beforehand. And this is really a better tolerated, more effective drug than we've ever had. How it's going to impact bariatric surgery is not obvious, although I believe it will increase surgery over time. Interesting, can you say more about that? There's this large pool of untreated obese patients, some of whom will start thinking about treatment because of medication, and some of whom will not be happy with the outcome, but now they're thinking about treatment. Some of them will be happy with the outcome, recognize how wonderful it is to be 50 pounds lighter, but won't want to stay on the medications or have significant side effects they can't tolerate. Stigma, Abuse, and Changing Perceptions about Obesity Sounds like Ozempic and similar drugs may lower the barrier for people to begin addressing their disease as opposed to perhaps a sense of resignation. Right. Which is what most people have. It's like, “Oh, I'll get this under control at some point. This is in my control. I could do this if I really decided to.” They blame themselves. They beat themselves up about why they can't do it. And really, it's not about that. Now, there is a percentage of patients who are addicted. They don't just have the disease of hunger but have the disease of addiction. Usually those are carb abusers. Some people say that surgery turns that around for them. Some people with these meds say the cravings for sweets and stuff have gone away, but not for everybody. I have heard people talk about the quieting down or the food yearnings. Basically, that's how these work. They are satiety hormones. Overcoming stigma/judgment and opening to the idea that there are treatments and help available seems profound and promising. Or just having false beliefs about it. It's hard to fight what society has told you, which is that this is your fault. It's in your control. Just shut up and stop eating. I can't tell you how many medical professionals I've heard say that. They just don't understand this as a disease. Well, it is a disease, and just like suboxone for narcotics addiction shuts off the drive, this is similar. Maybe even a better situation because it's a natural substance that's in your body that we're just augmenting. It can be hard for people to imagine things being different. We can get used to things that are pretty awful. That's right. I think it's a complacency. The devil you know versus the scary thing you don't know. And maybe being able to shift from being afraid to becoming hopeful. Right. Or being afraid of intervention. The nice thing about medication is you can come off it. I've seen some patients get gallstones from the medication, but that's a common thing with weight loss in general. I've seen a few patients who've had pancreatitis as a result of medication. I haven't seen anybody with bad pancreatitis, but that certainly will happen. Some patients will get bad or lifelong pancreatitis from having taken the medication. But it seems to be a relatively small percentage so far. In the press, it seems that there are a good number of people taking Ozempic who are not medically obese. I don't think we know what percentage of patients taking the drug are obese versus not obese. I just don't think we have data on it yet. You could call it a drug of abuse. Everybody wants to be 10 pounds lighter. I know a lot of people who are taking it just for 10 or 15 pounds. It doesn't make sense to me because we just don't know enough about these drugs and the benefits versus the potential risks long-term. They haven't been around for 10 years, never mind 20 and longer. We just don't know enough. It's one thing when you have a severe disease, but we're still learning, and I think ten years from now it might be a reasonable thing to do. Right now, it's a fashionable thing to do. Can you touch on what you envision the future of bariatric care might look like? Bariatric surgery touches on the distension of the stomach and signaling fullness much sooner when you eat from nerve impulses to the brain, not just hormonal impulses to the brain. It causes the release of multiple hormones, not just one or two that we're able to touch. Now, one of the big ones is PYY [a peptide released in the small intestine that reduces appetite], which has been shown to be one of the more powerful satiety hormones. But when used so far in clinical trials, it causes a fair bit more nausea than the GLP-1s do. So, it's not being used clinically yet. But if that could be figured out, then we may be looking at a scenario where we can employ a system like what's used to manage blood pressure or diabetes, with multiple drugs. I think we're looking at a future where you may be taking multiple drugs or combination drugs, either injection or pill, that hit up on these multiple hormones. I think that's going to be in the future. And in the short term, the bariatric surgery practice is expanding. What does that entail? We’re going to start offering primary medical treatment within the bariatric program. The medical program already exists, they're just overwhelmed. So, we're adding to that. If somebody calls the office that has a BMI over 30 with a comorbidity, or over 35 without a comorbidity, we will offer them both medical and surgical management depending on what they're interested in. Whereas before, we used to refer patients out for medical management. This is close to the biggest health problem out there. And our toolbox is expanding.

We know that adherence to a medical regimen is not great. So as soon as you lose some weight and see you’re not losing weight anymore, a large percentage stop taking it. I wonder what's going to happen with insurance companies once they stop taking it, whether their insurance companies are going to allow them to go back on it. The bottom line is: will they go back on it? I don't know yet how this will work out on the medical versus surgical end. In the treatment of obesity, there was basically nothing decent beforehand. And this is really a better tolerated, more effective drug than we've ever had. How it's going to impact bariatric surgery is not obvious, although I believe it will increase surgery over time. Interesting, can you say more about that? There's this large pool of untreated obese patients, some of whom will start thinking about treatment because of medication, and some of whom will not be happy with the outcome, but now they're thinking about treatment. Some of them will be happy with the outcome, recognize how wonderful it is to be 50 pounds lighter, but won't want to stay on the medications or have significant side effects they can't tolerate. Stigma, Abuse, and Changing Perceptions about Obesity Sounds like Ozempic and similar drugs may lower the barrier for people to begin addressing their disease as opposed to perhaps a sense of resignation. Right. Which is what most people have. It's like, “Oh, I'll get this under control at some point. This is in my control. I could do this if I really decided to.” They blame themselves. They beat themselves up about why they can't do it. And really, it's not about that. Now, there is a percentage of patients who are addicted. They don't just have the disease of hunger but have the disease of addiction. Usually those are carb abusers. Some people say that surgery turns that around for them. Some people with these meds say the cravings for sweets and stuff have gone away, but not for everybody. I have heard people talk about the quieting down or the food yearnings. Basically, that's how these work. They are satiety hormones. Overcoming stigma/judgment and opening to the idea that there are treatments and help available seems profound and promising. Or just having false beliefs about it. It's hard to fight what society has told you, which is that this is your fault. It's in your control. Just shut up and stop eating. I can't tell you how many medical professionals I've heard say that. They just don't understand this as a disease. Well, it is a disease, and just like suboxone for narcotics addiction shuts off the drive, this is similar. Maybe even a better situation because it's a natural substance that's in your body that we're just augmenting. It can be hard for people to imagine things being different. We can get used to things that are pretty awful. That's right. I think it's a complacency. The devil you know versus the scary thing you don't know. And maybe being able to shift from being afraid to becoming hopeful. Right. Or being afraid of intervention. The nice thing about medication is you can come off it. I've seen some patients get gallstones from the medication, but that's a common thing with weight loss in general. I've seen a few patients who've had pancreatitis as a result of medication. I haven't seen anybody with bad pancreatitis, but that certainly will happen. Some patients will get bad or lifelong pancreatitis from having taken the medication. But it seems to be a relatively small percentage so far. In the press, it seems that there are a good number of people taking Ozempic who are not medically obese. I don't think we know what percentage of patients taking the drug are obese versus not obese. I just don't think we have data on it yet. You could call it a drug of abuse. Everybody wants to be 10 pounds lighter. I know a lot of people who are taking it just for 10 or 15 pounds. It doesn't make sense to me because we just don't know enough about these drugs and the benefits versus the potential risks long-term. They haven't been around for 10 years, never mind 20 and longer. We just don't know enough. It's one thing when you have a severe disease, but we're still learning, and I think ten years from now it might be a reasonable thing to do. Right now, it's a fashionable thing to do. Can you touch on what you envision the future of bariatric care might look like? Bariatric surgery touches on the distension of the stomach and signaling fullness much sooner when you eat from nerve impulses to the brain, not just hormonal impulses to the brain. It causes the release of multiple hormones, not just one or two that we're able to touch. Now, one of the big ones is PYY [a peptide released in the small intestine that reduces appetite], which has been shown to be one of the more powerful satiety hormones. But when used so far in clinical trials, it causes a fair bit more nausea than the GLP-1s do. So, it's not being used clinically yet. But if that could be figured out, then we may be looking at a scenario where we can employ a system like what's used to manage blood pressure or diabetes, with multiple drugs. I think we're looking at a future where you may be taking multiple drugs or combination drugs, either injection or pill, that hit up on these multiple hormones. I think that's going to be in the future. And in the short term, the bariatric surgery practice is expanding. What does that entail? We’re going to start offering primary medical treatment within the bariatric program. The medical program already exists, they're just overwhelmed. So, we're adding to that. If somebody calls the office that has a BMI over 30 with a comorbidity, or over 35 without a comorbidity, we will offer them both medical and surgical management depending on what they're interested in. Whereas before, we used to refer patients out for medical management. This is close to the biggest health problem out there. And our toolbox is expanding.

The neon gas in this image is also excited – ionized and emitting light. Neon gas spells ‘open’ with the help of a few thousand volts needed to ionize it. Discovery of Neon Dr. Doug Stewart Neon was discovered in 1898 by William Ramsay and Morris Travers at University College London. This was not the first time Ramsay had discovered a new element. In 1894, he and Lord Rayleigh had discovered argon. Then, in 1895, Ramsay obtained the world’s first sample of helium. (Cleve and Langlet independently also obtained helium.) Ramsay was aware an element must sit between helium and argon in the periodic table. But how could he find it? Having found helium in a radioactive mineral, Ramsay thought it was possible he could find the new element in another such mineral. He and Travers spent some time working with a number of minerals, trying unsuccessfully to drive out some of the as yet undiscovered gas. (1) Aware of the history of chemistry, Ramsay knew that sometimes one new element can hide another. For example, Berzelius discovered cerium in the mineral that came to be known as cerite.\tSome years later Mosander, one of Berzelius’s former students, who had continued to study cerite, discovered the new element lanthanum . Lanthanum had been present in the cerite all along, but Berzelius had not found it. Ramsay wondered about the possibility of finding small amounts of the elusive new element hiding in one of his earlier discoveries, argon . Ramsay and Travers froze a sample of argon using liquid air. They then slowly evaporated the argon under reduced pressure and collected the first gas that came off. To obtain the gas’s spectrum, Ramsay applied a high voltage to the gas in a vacuum tube and we may reasonably guess that his mouth fell open at what he saw. Travers later commented, “the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget… For the moment the actual spectrum of the gas did not matter in the least, for nothing in the world gave a glow such as we had seen.” (2) This was the first time anyone had seen the glow of a neon light. Ramsay named the newly discovered element ‘neon’ which is Greek for ‘new.’ Interesting Facts about Neon 0.0018 percent of Earth’s atmosphere is neon. Although it is relatively rare on our planet, neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe. If you could gather all the neon from the rooms in a typical new home in the United States, you would get 10 liters (2 gallons) of neon gas. (3),(4) Neon forms in stars with a mass of eight or more Earth suns. Near the end of their lives, these stars enter the carbon burning phase, also making oxygen , sodium and magnesium . (For oxygen production, stars need a mass of ‘just’ five of our suns.) (5),(6) Neon has no stable compounds. Neon glowing in high voltage from Tesla coil. Glowing neon an exhibition of the Museum of Neon Art. Appearance and Characteristics Harmful effects: Neon is not known to be toxic. Characteristics: Neon is a light, very inert gas. Colorless under normal conditions, it glows a reddish-orange in a vacuum discharge tube. Neon forms no known stable compounds. It has the smallest liquid range of any element (2.6 o C). Uses of Neon When a few thousand volts are applied to neon, it emits an orange/red light. It is therefore often used in brightly lit advertising signs. Georges Claude was the first person to make glass tubes of neon in 1910. He later bent the glass tubes to makes letters that glowed and produced the first neon advertising signs. Neon is also used in high-voltage warning indicators, in Geiger counters and in television tubes. Liquid neon is used as a cryogenic refrigerant.

USE BUTTONS TO EXPLORE AVAILABLE RESOURCES TEACHER RESOURCE CONTENT ARTICLE CURRIULUM CONNECTIONS EXPLORE ARTICLE RESOURCE Smooth moves from a Smooth Criminal – Explaining Michael Jackson’s dance lean Michael Jackson’s signature lean in concert. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn’t agree that Michael Jackson was one of the most influential musical artists of our time.  But it wasn’t only music he influenced and revolutionised. His dance moves defined pop music choreography, and pushed dancers to do more and more extreme moves. Now one of his signature moves – the extreme lean from Smooth Criminal – has come under the microscope, with a group of Indian neurosurgeons and self-confessed Jackson fans, discussing how he pulled off the move in the Journal of Neurosurgery Spine, and cautioning against those wanting to replicate their idol. Mind-boggling lean The shift of the fulcrum from the sacrum to the Achilles tendon in MJ’s antigravity tilt. Credit: Manjul Tripathi. In the video for Smooth Criminal, and then replicated live in concerts around the world, Jackson and his backup dancers perform a mind-boggling lean, which sees their bodies tilted forwards from the ankle at an angle of 45 degrees from vertical. When someone stands upright, their centre of mass lies in front of the second sacral vertebra . If we were to bend forward at the waist, our erector spinae muscles in the back act like cables to support the spinal column and prevent us from toppling as that centre of gravity moves forwards. Even a trained dancer, say the neurosurgeons, would only be able to lean around 20 degrees past vertical without toppling, far more upright than MJ’s 45 degrees. No strings attached So what was Jackson’s secret?  Well, apparently it wasn’t wires, but rather a mechanical widget in the form of a patented shoe. The ‘antigravity tilt’ (> 45° forward bend), the dance move introduced by Michael Jackson, in comparison to the normal limit of a human tilt (20° forward bend), as well as the conceptualized shoe designed by MJ and coinventors. Credit: Manjul Tripathi. The heel of the shoe contained a slot that locked onto a metallic peg that emerged from the stage at the right moment, locking his foot in place and providing an anchor to allow the extreme angles.  However, they say, even with this hitching system it would still require huge core strength to be able to lock his body into a rigid straight line while leaning over and pulling himself back upright. The University of Adelaide’s Associate Professor Dominic Thewlis , who was not involved in the paper but specialises in human biomechanics, agrees, but also points out it wasn’t something that only Jackson would be able to do. “Based on some very simple calculations from the information in the paper, the muscle force required to hold this position is massive.” “It’s genuinely surprising, we’re talking about huge forces on his ankles.” “Once Michael’s centre of mass exceeds the limits of the base of support (his foot) the system is really easily perturbed, so the only way to hold this position without losing balance would be to fix his ankle to the floor. The rest is down to core strength.” While the move would have required strength far beyond what a normal person could muster, Thewlis says that it was probably far from superhuman and that most trained dancers should have this kind of ability.  However, even with this strength, Thewlis points to the shoe design as being the vital ingredient in the show stopping move. “I honestly can’t see how anyone could do this without mechanical aid.” Do not try this at home It is those forces and the requirement for the special shoe that has the Indian doctors cautioning against trying to replicate Jackson’s moves at home. “Several MJ fans, including the authors, have tried to copy this move and failed, often injuring themselves in their endeavours,” they wrote. The chances of someone injuring their ankles while trying to make the lean are significant, they said. Talking to the BBC , the authors added “You need strong core muscles and good support around the ankle. It’s not a simple trick.” Since Jackson’s prime, dancers have continually challenged themselves to jump higher, stretch further and move faster than before. With this comes more strain on their bodies, and the neurosurgeons say they are expecting to see new, unique spinal injuries as dancers push themselves further, inspired by the phenomenon that was Michael Jackson.

You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn’t agree that Michael Jackson was one of the most influential musical artists of our time.  But it wasn’t only music he influenced and revolutionised. His dance moves defined pop music choreography, and pushed dancers to do more and more extreme moves. Now one of his signature moves – the extreme lean from Smooth Criminal – has come under the microscope, with a group of Indian neurosurgeons and self-confessed Jackson fans, discussing how he pulled off the move in the Journal of Neurosurgery Spine, and cautioning against those wanting to replicate their idol. Mind-boggling lean The shift of the fulcrum from the sacrum to the Achilles tendon in MJ’s antigravity tilt. Credit: Manjul Tripathi. In the video for Smooth Criminal, and then replicated live in concerts around the world, Jackson and his backup dancers perform a mind-boggling lean, which sees their bodies tilted forwards from the ankle at an angle of 45 degrees from vertical. When someone stands upright, their centre of mass lies in front of the second sacral vertebra . If we were to bend forward at the waist, our erector spinae muscles in the back act like cables to support the spinal column and prevent us from toppling as that centre of gravity moves forwards. Even a trained dancer, say the neurosurgeons, would only be able to lean around 20 degrees past vertical without toppling, far more upright than MJ’s 45 degrees. No strings attached So what was Jackson’s secret?  Well, apparently it wasn’t wires, but rather a mechanical widget in the form of a patented shoe. The ‘antigravity tilt’ (> 45° forward bend), the dance move introduced by Michael Jackson, in comparison to the normal limit of a human tilt (20° forward bend), as well as the conceptualized shoe designed by MJ and coinventors. Credit: Manjul Tripathi. The heel of the shoe contained a slot that locked onto a metallic peg that emerged from the stage at the right moment, locking his foot in place and providing an anchor to allow the extreme angles.  However, they say, even with this hitching system it would still require huge core strength to be able to lock his body into a rigid straight line while leaning over and pulling himself back upright. The University of Adelaide’s Associate Professor Dominic Thewlis , who was not involved in the paper but specialises in human biomechanics, agrees, but also points out it wasn’t something that only Jackson would be able to do. “Based on some very simple calculations from the information in the paper, the muscle force required to hold this position is massive.” “It’s genuinely surprising, we’re talking about huge forces on his ankles.” “Once Michael’s centre of mass exceeds the limits of the base of support (his foot) the system is really easily perturbed, so the only way to hold this position without losing balance would be to fix his ankle to the floor. The rest is down to core strength.” While the move would have required strength far beyond what a normal person could muster, Thewlis says that it was probably far from superhuman and that most trained dancers should have this kind of ability.  However, even with this strength, Thewlis points to the shoe design as being the vital ingredient in the show stopping move. “I honestly can’t see how anyone could do this without mechanical aid.” Do not try this at home It is those forces and the requirement for the special shoe that has the Indian doctors cautioning against trying to replicate Jackson’s moves at home. “Several MJ fans, including the authors, have tried to copy this move and failed, often injuring themselves in their endeavours,” they wrote. The chances of someone injuring their ankles while trying to make the lean are significant, they said. Talking to the BBC , the authors added “You need strong core muscles and good support around the ankle. It’s not a simple trick.” Since Jackson’s prime, dancers have continually challenged themselves to jump higher, stretch further and move faster than before. With this comes more strain on their bodies, and the neurosurgeons say they are expecting to see new, unique spinal injuries as dancers push themselves further, inspired by the phenomenon that was Michael Jackson.

To learn more about how the test works and how to do it by hand, I invite you to read the article “ Chi-square test of independence by hand ”. To briefly recap what have been said in that article, the Chi-square test of independence tests whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables . The null and alternative hypotheses are: H 0 : the variables are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable does not help to predict the value of the other variable H 1 : the variables are dependent, there is a relationship between the two categorical variables. Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable The Chi-square test of independence works by comparing the observed frequencies (so the frequencies observed in your sample) to the expected frequencies if there was no relationship between the two categorical variables (so the expected frequencies if the null hypothesis was true). Data For our example, let’s reuse the dataset introduced in the article “ Descriptive statistics in R ”. This dataset is the well-known iris dataset slightly enhanced. Since there is only one categorical variable and the Chi-square test of independence requires two categorical variables, we add the variable size which corresponds to small if the length of the petal is smaller than the median of all flowers, big otherwise: dat <- iris\n\ndat $size <- ifelse(dat $Sepal .Length < median(dat $Sepal .Length), \"small\" , \"big\" ) We now create a contingency table of the two variables Species and size with the table() function: table(dat $Species , dat $size ) # # # # big small # # setosa 1 49 # # versicolor 29 21 # # virginica 47 3 The contingency table gives the observed number of cases in each subgroup. For instance, there is only one big setosa flower, while there are 49 small setosa flowers in the dataset. It is also a good practice to draw a barplot to visually represent the data: library(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(dat) +\n aes(x = Species, fill = size) +\n geom_bar() If you prefer to visualize it in terms of proportions (so that bars all have a height of 1, or 100%): ggplot (dat) + aes (x = Species, fill = size) + geom_bar (position = \"fill\" ) This second barplot is particularly useful if there are a different number of observations in each level of the variable drawn on the x -axis because it allows to compare the two variables on the same ground. If you prefer to have the bars next to each other: ggplot (dat) + aes (x = Species, fill = size) + geom_bar (position = \"dodge\" ) See the article “ Graphics in R with ggplot2 ” to learn how to create this kind of barplot in {ggplot2} . Chi-square test of independence in R For this example, we are going to test in R if there is a relationship between the variables Species and size . For this, the chisq.test() function is used: test <- chisq.test(table(dat $Species , dat $size )) test # # # # \tPearson's Chi-squared test # # # # data: table(dat$Species, dat$size) # # X-squared = 86.035, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16 Everything you need appears in this output: the title of the test, which variables have been used, the test statistic, the degrees of freedom and the p -value of the test. You can also retrieve the χ 2 test statistic and the p -value with: test $statistic # test statistic # # X-squared # # 86.03451 test $p .value # p-value ## [1] 2 .078944e-19 If you need to find the expected frequencies, use test$expected . If a warning such as “Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect” appears, it means that the smallest expected frequencies is lower than 5. To avoid this issue, you can either: gather some levels (especially those with a small number of observations) to increase the number of observations in the subgroups, or use the Fisher’s exact test The Fisher’s exact test does not require the assumption of a minimum of 5 expected counts in the contingency table. It can be applied in R thanks to the function fisher.test() . This test is similar to the Chi-square test in terms of hypothesis and interpretation of the results. Learn more about this test in this article dedicated to this type of test. Talking about assumptions, the Chi-square test of independence requires that the observations are independent. This is usually not tested formally, but rather verified based on the design of the experiment and on the good control of experimental conditions. If you are not sure, ask yourself if one observation is related to another (if one observation has an impact on another). If not, it is most likely that you have independent observations. If you have dependent observations (paired samples), the McNemar’s or Cochran’s Q tests should be used instead. The McNemar’s test is used when we want to know if there is a significant change in two paired samples (typically in a study with a measure before and after on the same subject) when the variables have only two categories. The Cochran’s Q tests is an extension of the McNemar’s test when we have more than two related measures. For your information, there are three other methods to perform the Chi-square test of independence in R: with the summary() function with the assocstats() function from the {vcd} package with the ctable() function from the {summarytools} package # second method: summary(table(dat $Species , dat $size )) # # Number of cases in table: 150 # # Number of factors: 2 # # Test for independence of all factors: # # \tChisq = 86.03, df = 2, p-value = 2.079e-19 # third method: library(vcd)\n\nassocstats(table(dat $Species , dat $size )) # # X^2 df P(> X^2) # # Likelihood Ratio 107.308 2 0 # # Pearson 86.035 2 0 # # # # Phi-Coefficient : NA # # Contingency Coeff.: 0.604 # # Cramer's V : 0.757 library(summarytools)\nlibrary(dplyr) # fourth method: dat %$%\n ctable(Species, size,\n prop = \"r\" , chisq = TRUE , headings = FALSE ) %>% print (\n method = \"render\" ,\n style = \"rmarkdown\" ,\n footnote = NA\n ) As you can see all four methods give the same results. If you do not have the same p -values with your data across the different methods, make sure to add the correct = FALSE argument in the chisq.test() function to prevent from applying the Yate’s continuity correction, which is applied by default in this method. 1 Conclusion and interpretation From the output and from test$p.value we see that the p -value is less than the significance level of 5%. Like any other statistical test , if the p -value is less than the significance level, we can reject the null hypothesis. If you are not familiar with p -values, I invite you to read this section . ⇒ In our context, rejecting the null hypothesis for the Chi-square test of independence means that there is a significant relationship between the species and the size. Therefore, knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable. Combination of plot and statistical test I recently discovered the mosaic() function from the {vcd} package. This function has the advantage that it combines a mosaic plot (to visualize a contingency table) and the result of the Chi-square test of independence: library(vcd)\n\nmosaic(~ Species + size,\n direction = c( \"v\" , \"h\" ),\n data = dat,\n shade = TRUE ) As you can see, the mosaic plot is similar to the barplot presented above, but the p -value of the Chi-square test is also displayed at the bottom right. Moreover, this mosaic plot with colored cases shows where the observed frequencies deviates from the expected frequencies if the variables were independent. The red cases means that the observed frequencies are smaller than the expected frequencies, whereas the blue cases means that the observed frequencies are larger than the expected frequencies. An alternative is the ggbarstats() function from the {ggstatsplot} package: # load packages library(ggstatsplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2) # plot ggbarstats(\n data = dat,\n x = size,\n y = Species\n) + labs (caption = NULL ) # remove caption From the plot, it seems that big flowers are more likely to belong to the virginica species, while small flowers tend to belong to the setosa species. Species and size are thus expected to be dependent. This is confirmed thanks to the statistical results displayed in the subtitle of the plot. There are several results, but we can in this case focus on the p -value which is displayed after p = at the top (in the subtitle of the plot). As with the previous tests, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that species and size are dependent ( p -value < 0.001). Thanks for reading. I hope the article helped you to perform the Chi-square test of independence in R and interpret its results.

If you are not familiar with p -values, I invite you to read this section . ⇒ In our context, rejecting the null hypothesis for the Chi-square test of independence means that there is a significant relationship between the species and the size. Therefore, knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable. Combination of plot and statistical test I recently discovered the mosaic() function from the {vcd} package. This function has the advantage that it combines a mosaic plot (to visualize a contingency table) and the result of the Chi-square test of independence: library(vcd)\n\nmosaic(~ Species + size,\n direction = c( \"v\" , \"h\" ),\n data = dat,\n shade = TRUE ) As you can see, the mosaic plot is similar to the barplot presented above, but the p -value of the Chi-square test is also displayed at the bottom right. Moreover, this mosaic plot with colored cases shows where the observed frequencies deviates from the expected frequencies if the variables were independent. The red cases means that the observed frequencies are smaller than the expected frequencies, whereas the blue cases means that the observed frequencies are larger than the expected frequencies. An alternative is the ggbarstats() function from the {ggstatsplot} package: # load packages library(ggstatsplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2) # plot ggbarstats(\n data = dat,\n x = size,\n y = Species\n) + labs (caption = NULL ) # remove caption From the plot, it seems that big flowers are more likely to belong to the virginica species, while small flowers tend to belong to the setosa species. Species and size are thus expected to be dependent. This is confirmed thanks to the statistical results displayed in the subtitle of the plot. There are several results, but we can in this case focus on the p -value which is displayed after p = at the top (in the subtitle of the plot). As with the previous tests, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that species and size are dependent ( p -value < 0.001). Thanks for reading. I hope the article helped you to perform the Chi-square test of independence in R and interpret its results. If you would like to learn how to do this test by hand and how it works, read the article “ Chi-square test of independence by hand ”. If you want to go further and estimate the strength of the relationship between two categorical variables, see the binary logistic regression .

It appears as an off-white powder and is solid at room temperature. The compound consists of one magnesium atom bonded to two bromine atoms, forming an ionic lattice structure. Structurally, magnesium bromide is composed of Mg²⁺ cations and Br⁻ anions. The magnesium ion has an oxidation state of +2, and each bromide ion carries a -1 charge, balancing the overall charge of the compound. The ionic bonds result from the significant difference in electronegativity between magnesium and bromine atoms. It has a high melting point of approximately 711°C, indicative of the strong ionic bonds within its crystal lattice. The compound is highly soluble in water due to its ionic nature, which allows it to dissociate into magnesium and bromide ions readily. It is hygroscopic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the air, so it should be stored in airtight containers to maintain its purity. Magnesium dibromide is used in organic synthesis as a source of bromide ions. It can serve as a catalyst in various chemical reactions and is instrumental in the preparation of Grignard reagents when reacted with organic halides. These Grignard reagents are essential intermediates in the synthesis of a wide range of organic compounds, including alcohols, acids, and hydrocarbons. Magnesium bromide should be handled with care. It may cause skin and eye irritation upon contact, as indicated by hazard statements H315 (Causes skin irritation) and H319 (Causes serious eye irritation). Inhalation of dust may lead to respiratory irritation (H335). Appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves, safety goggles, and dust masks should be used when handling the compound to minimize exposure risks. The quality and purity of magnesium bromide are critical for its effectiveness in chemical syntheses. The product is typically offered at a purity of 98% or higher, verified by titration methods. Ensuring high purity is essential for laboratory and industrial applications where impurities could affect reaction outcomes. Magnesium bromide is a valuable inorganic compound in the chemical industry, particularly in organic synthesis. Its ionic properties and reactivity make it a useful reagent for various applications, provided it is stored properly and handled with appropriate safety precautions. Magnesium bromide is used as a catalyst for many reactions. Such as being a solvent-free one-pot synthesis of dihydropyrimidinones which are used most often in the pharmaceutical industry. MgBr 2 in combination with CH 2 Cl 2 catalyzes a reaction that causes specific symmetry and chiral centers through hydrogenation of alkenes. This product, when bonded to other functional groups, has shown more practical uses other than catalyzing reactions. When bonded to an ethyl group it is used for the regiospecific analysis of triglycerols. Magnesium dibromide was also used to synthesize the first stable magnesium silylenoid.

    "html": "Math Tutor Explains: What is 2 to the Power of 5? | Thinkster Math Math Tutor Explains: What is 2 to the Power of 5? A math tutor would explain that to solve for 2 to the power of 5, we must first understand the structure. The number 2 is called the base, and the number 5 is called the exponent. In short, the base must be multiplied by itself the number of times as the exponent. Let’s look at this problem in more detail. Math Tutor's Solution: 2 to the Power of 5 is equal to 32 Methods Step-by-step from math tutor: finding 2 to the power of 5 The first step a math tutor would suggest is to understand what it means when a number has an exponent. The “power” of a number indicates how many times the base would be multiplied by itself to reach the correct value. The second step is to write the number in the base-exponent form, and lastly calculate what the final result would be. Consider the example of 2 to the power of 4: in exponent form that would be 2 4 2^4 2 4 . To solve this, we need to multiply the base, 2 by itself, 4 times - 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 16. So 2 4 = 16 2^4 = 16 2 4 = 16 . So re-applying these steps to our particular problem, we first convert our word problem to a base-exponent form of: 2 5 2^{5} 2 5 To simplify this, all that is needed is to multiply it out: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 Therefore, 2 to the power of 5 is 32.

    "html": "American crocodile - Climate Adaptation Explorer Climate Adaptation Explorer American crocodile Crocodylus acutus Photo: Agsftw Overall vulnerability: Moderate lower vulnerability higher vulnerability Conservation status: Federally Threatened General Information This reclusive reptile inhabits coastal areas throughout the Caribbean with a range limited to Puerto Rico and southern Florida within the United States. Crocodiles are similar in appearance to the more common American alligator but are lighter in color and have longer, more pointed V-shaped snouts. Like alligators, crocodiles are ectotherms and must control their body temperature by basking in the sun for warmth or moving to cooler areas. Crocodiles are top predators and are non-discriminatory in diet, taking any aquatic or terrestrial prey they are capable of capturing based on their body size. Habitat Requirements American crocodiles prefer coastal saltwater or brackish areas including the ponds or creeks of mangrove swamps but can also be found in inland freshwater bodies accessed through canals. Habitats: Beach and Surf Zone Coastal Uplands Estuarine/Marine (system wide) Mangrove Swamp Saltwater Marsh Habitat area: 76,784 hectares within Florida (modeled) 71,102 hectares ( 93 %) is located on public lands Habitat impacted by up to 3 meters sea level rise: Explore interactive map 100 % 1 meter 100 % 3 meters 0.0 % not impacted Climate Impacts American crocodile habitat is expected to become significantly inundated from even the most conservative estimates (one meter) of sea level rise. Under various sea level rise scenarios, 30 – 98% of current crocodile habitat will be inundated. Although new habitat may also become available as the sea levels rise, developed areas may create barriers to northward migration of mangroves and crocodile habitat. Sea level rise will also drive changes in water chemistry and salinity that may negatively impact current crocodile habitat even before inundation occurs. Changes in temperature including direct mortality from cold snaps are also a potential threat. As crocodiles have temperature-dependent sex determination, altered sex ratios under changing temperature conditions are a major concern. More information about general climate impacts to species in Florida. Vulnerability Assessment(s) The overall vulnerability level was based on the following assessment(s): Climate Change Vulnerability Index Vulnerability: Extremely vulnerable The major factors contributing to the vulnerability to climate change for the American crocodile include sea level rise, anthropogenic barriers that may inhibit the species ability to track climatic shifts, changes in the timing/intensity of hurricanes that might impact nest success, changes to hydrology that might affect salinity, and the potential for lower than average genetic variability. Approximately 90% of the species' nesting habitat is expected to be impacted by a 1-meter sea level rise. Developed areas, such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples, and roads are anthropogenic barriers impacting this species. Shoreline hardening is a potential factor having a negative impact on the availability of nesting habitat. This species is sensitive to changes in temperatures affecting nest substrate through impacts on offspring sex ratios. A major source of uncertainty is related to the impact of higher salinities on juveniles in nursery habitat. Decreased soil moisture may also have a potential negative impact on egg incubation and development. Increased hurricane intensity may lead to increased wind and overwash erosion of nesting sites. The potential for increased frequency of cold snaps could result in increased direct mortality. Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment Vulnerability: Moderately vulnerable The primary factors contributing to vulnerability for the American crocodile are sea level rise, erosion, changes in salinity, and runoff and storm surge, and synergies with development.

    "html1": "American crocodile - Climate Adaptation Explorer Climate Adaptation Explorer American crocodile Crocodylus acutus Photo: Agsftw Overall vulnerability: Moderate lower vulnerability higher vulnerability Conservation status: Federally Threatened General Information This reclusive reptile inhabits coastal areas throughout the Caribbean with a range limited to Puerto Rico and southern Florida within the United States. Crocodiles are similar in appearance to the more common American alligator but are lighter in color and have longer, more pointed V-shaped snouts. Like alligators, crocodiles are ectotherms and must control their body temperature by basking in the sun for warmth or moving to cooler areas. Crocodiles are top predators and are non-discriminatory in diet, taking any aquatic or terrestrial prey they are capable of capturing based on their body size. Habitat Requirements American crocodiles prefer coastal saltwater or brackish areas including the ponds or creeks of mangrove swamps but can also be found in inland freshwater bodies accessed through canals. Habitats: Beach and Surf Zone Coastal Uplands Estuarine/Marine (system wide) Mangrove Swamp Saltwater Marsh Habitat area: 76,784 hectares within Florida (modeled) 71,102 hectares ( 93 %) is located on public lands Habitat impacted by up to 3 meters sea level rise: Explore interactive map 100 % 1 meter 100 % 3 meters 0.0 % not impacted Climate Impacts American crocodile habitat is expected to become significantly inundated from even the most conservative estimates (one meter) of sea level rise. Under various sea level rise scenarios, 30 – 98% of current crocodile habitat will be inundated. Although new habitat may also become available as the sea levels rise, developed areas may create barriers to northward migration of mangroves and crocodile habitat. Sea level rise will also drive changes in water chemistry and salinity that may negatively impact current crocodile habitat even before inundation occurs. Changes in temperature including direct mortality from cold snaps are also a potential threat. As crocodiles have temperature-dependent sex determination, altered sex ratios under changing temperature conditions are a major concern. More information about general climate impacts to species in Florida. Vulnerability Assessment(s) The overall vulnerability level was based on the following assessment(s): Climate Change Vulnerability Index Vulnerability: Extremely vulnerable The major factors contributing to the vulnerability to climate change for the American crocodile include sea level rise, anthropogenic barriers that may inhibit the species ability to track climatic shifts, changes in the timing/intensity of hurricanes that might impact nest success, changes to hydrology that might affect salinity, and the potential for lower than average genetic variability. Approximately 90% of the species' nesting habitat is expected to be impacted by a 1-meter sea level rise. Developed areas, such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples, and roads are anthropogenic barriers impacting this species. Shoreline hardening is a potential factor having a negative impact on the availability of nesting habitat. This species is sensitive to changes in temperatures affecting nest substrate through impacts on offspring sex ratios. A major source of uncertainty is related to the impact of higher salinities on juveniles in nursery habitat. Decreased soil moisture may also have a potential negative impact on egg incubation and development. Increased hurricane intensity may lead to increased wind and overwash erosion of nesting sites. The potential for increased frequency of cold snaps could result in increased direct mortality. Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value Assessment Vulnerability: Moderately vulnerable The primary factors contributing to vulnerability for the American crocodile are sea level rise, erosion, changes in salinity, and runoff and storm surge, and synergies with development. Adaptation Strategies Monitoring crocodile populations and nesting success is an important first step in identifying early impacts from climate-driven stressors and determining when further intervention is necessary. If nesting and nursery habitat becomes degraded or sex ratios are impacted by rising temperatures, artificially created or altered nesting or nursery habitat to maintain nesting success and optimal sex ratios is a possible adaptation strategy. For example, shade structures could be added to nesting sites to improve the likelihood of achieving balanced sex ratios.

In this chapter we will study some techniques for solving equations having one variable. To accomplish this we will use the skills learned while manipulating the numbers and symbols of algebra as well as the operations on whole numbers, decimals, and fractions that you learned in arithmetics. CONDITIONAL AND EQUIVALENT EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Classify an equation as conditional or an identity. Solve simple equations mentally. Determine if certain equations are equivalent. An equation is a statement in symbols that two number expressions are equal. Equations can be classified in two main types: 1. An identity is true for all values of the literal and arithmetical numbers in it. Example 1 5 x 4 = 20 is an identity. Example 2 2 + 3 = 5 is an identity. Example 3 2x + 3x = 5x is an identity since any value substituted for x will yield an equality. 2. A conditional equation is true for only certain values of the literal numbers in it. Example 4 x + 3 = 9 is true only if the literal number x = 6. Example 5 3x - 4 = 11 is true only if x = 5. The literal numbers in an equation are sometimes referred to as variables . Finding the values that make a conditional equation true is one of the main objectives of this text. A solution or root of an equation is the value of the variable or variables that make the equation a true statement. The solution or root is said to satisfy the equation . Solving an equation means finding the solution or root. Many equations can be solved mentally. Ability to solve an equation mentally will depend on the ability to manipulate the numbers of arithmetic. The better you know the facts of multiplication and addition, the more adept you will be at mentally solving equations. Example 6 Solve for x: x + 3 = 7 Solution To have a true statement we need a value for x that, when added to 3, will yield 7. Our knowledge of arithmetic indicates that 4 is the needed value. Therefore the solution to the equation is x = 4. What number added to 3 equals 7? Example 7 Solve for x: x - 5 = 3 Solution What number do we subtract 5 from to obtain 3? Again our experience with arithmetic tells us that 8 - 5 = 3. Therefore the solution is x = 8. Example 8 Solve for x: 3x = 15 Solution What number must be multiplied by 3 to obtain 15? Our answer is x = 5. Solution What number do we divide 2 by to obtain 7? Our answer is 14. Example 10 Solve for x: 2x - 1 = 5 Solution We would subtract 1 from 6 to obtain 5. Thus 2x = 6. Then\nx = 3. Regardless of how an equation is solved, the solution should always be checked for correctness. Example 11 A student solved the equation 5x - 3 = 4x + 2 and found an answer of x = 6. Was this right or wrong? Solution Does x = 6 satisfy the equation 5x - 3 = 4x + 2? To check we substitute 6 for x in the equation to see if we obtain a true statement. This is not a true statement, so the answer x = 6 is wrong. Another student solved the same equation and found x = 5. This is a true statement, so x = 5 is correct. Many students think that when they have found the solution to an equation, the problem is finished. Not so! The final step should always be to check the solution. Not all equations can be solved mentally. We now wish to introduce an idea that is a step toward an orderly process for solving equations. Is x = 3 a solution of x - 1 = 2? Is x = 3 a solution of 2x + I = 7? What can be said about the equations x - 1 = 2 and 2x + 1 = 7? Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution or solutions Example 12 3x = 6 and 2x + 1 = 5 are equivalent because in both cases x = 2 is a solution. Techniques for solving equations will involve processes for changing an equation to an equivalent equation. If a complicated equation such as 2x - 4 + 3x = 7x + 2 - 4x can be changed to a simple equation x = 3, and the equation x = 3 is equivalent to the original equation, then we have solved the equation. Two questions now become very important. Are two equations equivalent? How can we change an equation to another equation that is equivalent to it? The answer to the first question is found by using the substitution principle. Example 13 Are 5x + 2 = 6x - 1 and x = 3 equivalent equations? Solution The answer to the second question involves the techniques for solving equations that will be discussed in the next few sections. To use the substitution principle correctly we must substitute the numeral 3 for x wherever x appears in the equation. THE DIVISION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the division rule to solve equations. Solve some basic applied problems whose solutions involve using the division rule. As mentioned earlier, we wish to present an orderly procedure for solving equations. This procedure will involve the four basic operations, the first of which is presented in this section. If each term of an equation is divided by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. To prepare to use the division rule for solving equations we must make note of the following process: (We usually write 1x as x with the coefficient 1 understood.) Example 1 Solve for x: 3x = 10 Solution Our goal is to obtain x = some number. The division rule allows us to divide each term of 3x = 10 by the same number, and our goal of finding a value of x would indicate that we divide by 3. This would give us a coefficient of 1 for x. Check: 3x = 10 and x = these equivalent equations? We substitute for x in the first equation obtaining The equations are equivalent, so the solution is correct. Always Check! Example 2 Solve for x: 5x = 20 Solution Notice that the division rule does not allow us to divide by zero. Since dividing by zero is not allowed in mathematics, expressions such as are meaningless. Example 3 Solve for x: 8x = 4 Solution Errors are sometimes made in very simple situations. Don't glance at this problem and arrive at x = 2! Note that the division rule allows us to divide each term of an equation by any nonzero number and the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. Therefore we could divide each side of the equation by 5 and obtain , which is equivalent to the original equation. Dividing by 5 does not help find the solution however. What number should we divide by to find the solution? Example 4 Solve for x: 0.5x = 6 Solution Example 6 The formula for finding the circumference (C) of a circle is C = 2πr, where π represents the radius of the circle and it is approximately 3.14. Find the radius of a circle if the circumference is measured to be 40.72 cm. Give the answer correct to two decimal places. Solution To solve a problem involving a formula we first use the substitution principle. Circumference means \"distance around.\" It is the perimeter of a circle. The radius is the distance from the center to the circle. THE SUBTRACTION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to use the subtraction rule to solve equations. The second step toward an orderly procedure for solving equations will be discussed in this section. You will use your knowledge of like terms from chapter l as well as the techniques from section THE DIVISION RULE . Notice how new ideas in algebra build on previous knowledge. If the same quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation, the resulting equation will be equivalent to the original equation. Example 1 Solve for x if x + 7 = 12. Solution Even though this equation can easily be solved mentally, we wish to illustrate the subtraction rule. We should think in this manner: \"I wish to solve for x so I need x by itself on one side of the equation. But I have x + 7. So if I subtract 7 from x + 7, I will have x alone on the left side.\" (Remember that a quantity subtracted from itself gives zero.) But if we subtract 7 from one side of the equation, the rule requires us to subtract 7 from the other side as well. So we proceed as follows: Note that\tx +\t0 may be written simply as x since zero added to any quantity equals the quantity itself. Example 2 Solve for x: 5x = 4x + 3 Solution Here our thinking should proceed in this manner. \"I wish to obtain all unknown quantities on one side of the equation and all numbers of arithmetic on the other so I have an equation of the form x = some number. I thus need to subtract Ax from both sides.\" Our goal is to arrive at x = some number. Remember that checking your solution is an important step in solving equations. Example 3 Solve for x: 3x + 6 = 2x + 11 Here we have a more involved task. First subtract 6 from both sides. Now we must eliminate 2x on the right side by subtracting 2x from both sides. We now look at a solution that requires the use of both the subtraction rule and the division rule. Note that instead of first subtracting 6 we could just as well first subtract 2x from both sides obtaining 3x - 2x + 6 = 2x - 2x + 11 x + 6 = 11. Then subtracting 6 from both sides we have x + 6 - 6 = 11 - 6 x = 5. Keep in mind that our goal is x = some number. Example 4 Solve for x: 3x + 2 = 17 Solution We first use the subtraction rule to subtract 2 from both sides obtaining Then we use the division rule to obtain Always check! Example 5 Solve for x: 7x + 1 = 5x + 9 Solution We first use the subtraction rule. Then the division rule gives us Example 6 The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is found by using the formula P = 2l+ 2w, where l stands for the length and w stands for the width. If the perimeter of a rectangle is 54 cm and the length is 15 cm, what is the width? Solution Perimeter is the distance around. Do you see why the formula is P = 2l + 2w? THE ADDITION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to use the addition rule to solve equations. We now proceed to the next operation in our goal of developing an orderly procedure for solving equations. Once again, we will rely on previous knowledge. If the same quantity is added to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation will be equivalent to the original equation. Example 1 Solve for x if x - 7 = 2. Solution As always, in solving an equation we wish to arrive at the form of \"x = some number.\" We observe that 7 has been subtracted from x, so to obtain x alone on the left side of the equation, we add 7 to both sides. Remember to always check your solution. Example 2 Solve for x: 2x - 3 = 6 Solution Keeping in mind our goal of obtaining x alone, we observe that since 3 has been subtracted from 2x, we add 3 to both sides of the equation. Now we must use the division rule. Why do we add 3 to both sides? Note that in the example just using the addition rule does not solve the problem. Example 3 Solve for x: 3x - 4 = 11 Solution We first use the addition rule. Then using the division rule, we obtain Here again, we needed to use both the addition rule and the division rule to solve the equation. Example 4 Solve for x: 5x = 14 - 2x Solution Here our goal of obtaining x alone on one side would suggest we eliminate the 2x on the right, so we add 2x to both sides of the equation. We next apply the division rule. Here again, we needed to use both the addition rule and the division rule to solve the equation. Note that we check by always substituting the solution in the original equation. Example 5 Solve for x: 3x - 2 = 8 - 2x Solution Here our task is more involved. We must think of eliminating the number 2 from the left side of the equation and also the lx from the right side to obtain x alone on one side. We may do either of these first. If we choose to first add 2x to both sides, we obtain We now add 2 to both sides. Finally the division rule gives Could we first add 2 to both sides? Try it! THE MULTIPLICATION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the multiplication rule to solve equations. Solve proportions. Solve some basic applied problems using the multiplication rule. We now come to the last of the four basic operations in developing our procedure for solving equations. We will also introduce ratio and proportion and use the multiplication rule to solve proportions. If each term of an equation is multiplied by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. In elementary arithmetic some of the most difficult operations are those involving fractions. The multiplication rule allows us to avoid these operations when solving an equation involving fractions by finding an equivalent equation that contains only whole numbers. Remember that when we multiply a whole number by a fraction, we use the rule We are now ready to solve an equation involving fractions. Note that in each case only the numerator of the fraction is multiplied by the whole number. Example 4 Solution Keep in mind that we wish to obtain x alone on one side of the equation. We also would like to obtain an equation in whole numbers that is equivalent to the given equation. To eliminate the fraction in the equation we need to multiply by a number that is divisible by the denominator 3. We thus use the multiplication rule and multiply each term of the equation by 3. We now have an equivalent equation that contains only whole numbers. Using the division rule, we obtain To eliminate the fraction we need to multiply by a number that is divisible by the denominator. In the example we need to multiply by a number that is divided by 3. We could have multiplied both sides by 6, 9, 12, and so on, but the equation is simpler and easier to work with if wc use the smallest multiple. Example 5 Solution See if you obtain the same solution by multiplying each side of the original equation by 16. Always check in the original equation. Example 6 Solution Here our task is the same but a little more complex. We have two fractions to eliminate. We must multiply each term of the equation by a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5. It is best to use the least of such numbers, which you will recall is the least common multiple . We will therefore multiply by 15. In arithmetic you may have referred to the least common multiple as the \"lowest common denominator.\" Example 7 Solution The least common multiple for 8 and 2 is 8, so we multiply each term of the equation by 8. We now use the subtraction rule. Finally the division rule gives us Before multiplying, change any mixed numbers to improper fractions. In this example change . Remember that each term must be multiplied by 8. Note that in this example we used three rules to find the solution. Solving simple equations by multiplying both sides by the same number occurs frequently in the study of ratio and proportion. A ratio is the quotient of two numbers. The ratio of a number x to a number y can be written as x:y or . In general, the fractional form is more meaningful and useful. Thus, we will write the ratio of 3 to 4 as . A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. Example 8 Solution We need to find a value of x such that the ratio of x to 15 is equal to the ratio of 2 to 5. Multiplying each side of the equation by 15, we obtain Why do we multiply both sides by 15? Check this solution in the original equation. Example 9 What number x has the same ratio to 3 as 6 has to 9? Solution To solve for x we first write the proportion: Next we multipy each side of the equation by 9. Say to yourself, \"2 is to 5 as x is to 10.\" Check! Example 11 The ratio of the number of women to the number of men in a math class is 7 to 8. If there are 24 men in the class, how many women are in the class? Solution Check! Example 12 Two sons were to divide an inheritance in the ratio of 3 to 5. If the son who received the larger portion got $20,000, what was the total amount of the inheritance? Solution We now add $20,000 + $12,000 to obtain the total amount of $32,000. Check! Again, be careful in setting up the proportion. In the ratio 3/5, 5 is the larger portion. Therefore, since $20,000 is the larger portion, it must also appear in the denominator. Example 13 If the legal requirements for room capacity require 3 cubic meters of air space per person, how many people can legally occupy a room that measures 6 meters wide, 8 meters long, and 3 meters high? Solution So, 48 people would be the legal room capacity. This means \"1 person is to 3 cubic meters as x people are to 144 cubic meters.\" Check the solution. COMBINING RULES FOR SOLVING EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use combinations of the various rules to solve more complex equations. Apply the orderly steps established in this section to systematically solve equations. Many of the exercises in previous sections have required the use of more than one rule in the solution process. In fact, it is possible that a single problem could involve all the rules There is no mandatory process for solving equations involving more than one rule, but experience has shown that the following order gives a smoother, more mistake-free procedure. First Eliminate fractions, if any, by multiplying each term of the equation by the least common multiple of all denominators of fractions in the equation. Second Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the equation. Third Add or subtract the necessary quantities to obtain the unknown quantity on one side and the numbers of arithmetic on the other side. Fourth Divide by the coefficient of the unknown quantity. Fifth Check your answer. Remember, the coefficient is the number being multiplied by the letter. (That is, in the expression 5x the coefficient is 5.) Again, make sure every term is\nmultiplied by 3. Solution Multiplying each term by 15 yields You may want to leave your answer as an improper fraction instead of a mixed number. Either form is correct, but the improper fraction form will be more useful in checking your solution. Note that there are four terms in this equation. Example 3 The selling price (S) of a certain article was $30.00. If the margin (M) was one-fifth of the cost (C), find the cost of the article. Use the formula C + M = S. Solution Since the margin was one-fifth of the cost, we may write SUMMARY Key Words An equation is a statement in symbols that two number expressions are equal. An identity is true for all values of the literal and arithmetic numbers in it. A conditional equation is true for only certain values of the literal numbers in it. A solution or root of an equation is the value of the variable that makes the equation a true statement. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution set. A ratio is the quotient of two numbers. A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. Procedures If each term of an equation is divided by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation.

CONDITIONAL AND EQUIVALENT EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Classify an equation as conditional or an identity. Solve simple equations mentally. Determine if certain equations are equivalent. An equation is a statement in symbols that two number expressions are equal. Equations can be classified in two main types: 1. An identity is true for all values of the literal and arithmetical numbers in it. Example 1 5 x 4 = 20 is an identity. Example 2 2 + 3 = 5 is an identity. Example 3 2x + 3x = 5x is an identity since any value substituted for x will yield an equality. 2. A conditional equation is true for only certain values of the literal numbers in it. Example 4 x + 3 = 9 is true only if the literal number x = 6. Example 5 3x - 4 = 11 is true only if x = 5. The literal numbers in an equation are sometimes referred to as variables . Finding the values that make a conditional equation true is one of the main objectives of this text. A solution or root of an equation is the value of the variable or variables that make the equation a true statement. The solution or root is said to satisfy the equation . Solving an equation means finding the solution or root. Many equations can be solved mentally. Ability to solve an equation mentally will depend on the ability to manipulate the numbers of arithmetic. The better you know the facts of multiplication and addition, the more adept you will be at mentally solving equations. Example 6 Solve for x: x + 3 = 7 Solution To have a true statement we need a value for x that, when added to 3, will yield 7. Our knowledge of arithmetic indicates that 4 is the needed value. Therefore the solution to the equation is x = 4. What number added to 3 equals 7? Example 7 Solve for x: x - 5 = 3 Solution What number do we subtract 5 from to obtain 3? Again our experience with arithmetic tells us that 8 - 5 = 3. Therefore the solution is x = 8. Example 8 Solve for x: 3x = 15 Solution What number must be multiplied by 3 to obtain 15? Our answer is x = 5. Solution What number do we divide 2 by to obtain 7? Our answer is 14. Example 10 Solve for x: 2x - 1 = 5 Solution We would subtract 1 from 6 to obtain 5. Thus 2x = 6. Then\nx = 3. Regardless of how an equation is solved, the solution should always be checked for correctness. Example 11 A student solved the equation 5x - 3 = 4x + 2 and found an answer of x = 6. Was this right or wrong? Solution Does x = 6 satisfy the equation 5x - 3 = 4x + 2? To check we substitute 6 for x in the equation to see if we obtain a true statement. This is not a true statement, so the answer x = 6 is wrong. Another student solved the same equation and found x = 5. This is a true statement, so x = 5 is correct. Many students think that when they have found the solution to an equation, the problem is finished. Not so! The final step should always be to check the solution. Not all equations can be solved mentally. We now wish to introduce an idea that is a step toward an orderly process for solving equations. Is x = 3 a solution of x - 1 = 2? Is x = 3 a solution of 2x + I = 7? What can be said about the equations x - 1 = 2 and 2x + 1 = 7? Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution or solutions Example 12 3x = 6 and 2x + 1 = 5 are equivalent because in both cases x = 2 is a solution. Techniques for solving equations will involve processes for changing an equation to an equivalent equation. If a complicated equation such as 2x - 4 + 3x = 7x + 2 - 4x can be changed to a simple equation x = 3, and the equation x = 3 is equivalent to the original equation, then we have solved the equation. Two questions now become very important. Are two equations equivalent? How can we change an equation to another equation that is equivalent to it? The answer to the first question is found by using the substitution principle. Example 13 Are 5x + 2 = 6x - 1 and x = 3 equivalent equations? Solution The answer to the second question involves the techniques for solving equations that will be discussed in the next few sections. To use the substitution principle correctly we must substitute the numeral 3 for x wherever x appears in the equation. THE DIVISION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the division rule to solve equations. Solve some basic applied problems whose solutions involve using the division rule. As mentioned earlier, we wish to present an orderly procedure for solving equations. This procedure will involve the four basic operations, the first of which is presented in this section. If each term of an equation is divided by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. To prepare to use the division rule for solving equations we must make note of the following process: (We usually write 1x as x with the coefficient 1 understood.) Example 1 Solve for x: 3x = 10 Solution Our goal is to obtain x = some number. The division rule allows us to divide each term of 3x = 10 by the same number, and our goal of finding a value of x would indicate that we divide by 3. This would give us a coefficient of 1 for x. Check: 3x = 10 and x = these equivalent equations? We substitute for x in the first equation obtaining The equations are equivalent, so the solution is correct. Always Check! Example 2 Solve for x: 5x = 20 Solution Notice that the division rule does not allow us to divide by zero. Since dividing by zero is not allowed in mathematics, expressions such as are meaningless. Example 3 Solve for x: 8x = 4 Solution Errors are sometimes made in very simple situations. Don't glance at this problem and arrive at x = 2! Note that the division rule allows us to divide each term of an equation by any nonzero number and the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. Therefore we could divide each side of the equation by 5 and obtain , which is equivalent to the original equation. Dividing by 5 does not help find the solution however. What number should we divide by to find the solution? Example 4 Solve for x: 0.5x = 6 Solution Example 6 The formula for finding the circumference (C) of a circle is C = 2πr, where π represents the radius of the circle and it is approximately 3.14. Find the radius of a circle if the circumference is measured to be 40.72 cm. Give the answer correct to two decimal places. Solution To solve a problem involving a formula we first use the substitution principle. Circumference means \"distance around.\" It is the perimeter of a circle. The radius is the distance from the center to the circle. THE SUBTRACTION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to use the subtraction rule to solve equations. The second step toward an orderly procedure for solving equations will be discussed in this section. You will use your knowledge of like terms from chapter l as well as the techniques from section THE DIVISION RULE . Notice how new ideas in algebra build on previous knowledge. If the same quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation, the resulting equation will be equivalent to the original equation. Example 1 Solve for x if x + 7 = 12. Solution Even though this equation can easily be solved mentally, we wish to illustrate the subtraction rule. We should think in this manner: \"I wish to solve for x so I need x by itself on one side of the equation. But I have x + 7. So if I subtract 7 from x + 7, I will have x alone on the left side.\" (Remember that a quantity subtracted from itself gives zero.) But if we subtract 7 from one side of the equation, the rule requires us to subtract 7 from the other side as well. So we proceed as follows: Note that\tx +\t0 may be written simply as x since zero added to any quantity equals the quantity itself. Example 2 Solve for x: 5x = 4x + 3 Solution Here our thinking should proceed in this manner. \"I wish to obtain all unknown quantities on one side of the equation and all numbers of arithmetic on the other so I have an equation of the form x = some number. I thus need to subtract Ax from both sides.\" Our goal is to arrive at x = some number. Remember that checking your solution is an important step in solving equations. Example 3 Solve for x: 3x + 6 = 2x + 11 Here we have a more involved task. First subtract 6 from both sides. Now we must eliminate 2x on the right side by subtracting 2x from both sides. We now look at a solution that requires the use of both the subtraction rule and the division rule. Note that instead of first subtracting 6 we could just as well first subtract 2x from both sides obtaining 3x - 2x + 6 = 2x - 2x + 11 x + 6 = 11. Then subtracting 6 from both sides we have x + 6 - 6 = 11 - 6 x = 5. Keep in mind that our goal is x = some number. Example 4 Solve for x: 3x + 2 = 17 Solution We first use the subtraction rule to subtract 2 from both sides obtaining Then we use the division rule to obtain Always check! Example 5 Solve for x: 7x + 1 = 5x + 9 Solution We first use the subtraction rule. Then the division rule gives us Example 6 The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is found by using the formula P = 2l+ 2w, where l stands for the length and w stands for the width. If the perimeter of a rectangle is 54 cm and the length is 15 cm, what is the width? Solution Perimeter is the distance around. Do you see why the formula is P = 2l + 2w? THE ADDITION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to use the addition rule to solve equations. We now proceed to the next operation in our goal of developing an orderly procedure for solving equations. Once again, we will rely on previous knowledge. If the same quantity is added to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation will be equivalent to the original equation. Example 1 Solve for x if x - 7 = 2. Solution As always, in solving an equation we wish to arrive at the form of \"x = some number.\" We observe that 7 has been subtracted from x, so to obtain x alone on the left side of the equation, we add 7 to both sides. Remember to always check your solution. Example 2 Solve for x: 2x - 3 = 6 Solution Keeping in mind our goal of obtaining x alone, we observe that since 3 has been subtracted from 2x, we add 3 to both sides of the equation. Now we must use the division rule. Why do we add 3 to both sides? Note that in the example just using the addition rule does not solve the problem. Example 3 Solve for x: 3x - 4 = 11 Solution We first use the addition rule. Then using the division rule, we obtain Here again, we needed to use both the addition rule and the division rule to solve the equation. Example 4 Solve for x: 5x = 14 - 2x Solution Here our goal of obtaining x alone on one side would suggest we eliminate the 2x on the right, so we add 2x to both sides of the equation. We next apply the division rule. Here again, we needed to use both the addition rule and the division rule to solve the equation. Note that we check by always substituting the solution in the original equation. Example 5 Solve for x: 3x - 2 = 8 - 2x Solution Here our task is more involved. We must think of eliminating the number 2 from the left side of the equation and also the lx from the right side to obtain x alone on one side. We may do either of these first. If we choose to first add 2x to both sides, we obtain We now add 2 to both sides. Finally the division rule gives Could we first add 2 to both sides? Try it! THE MULTIPLICATION RULE OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the multiplication rule to solve equations. Solve proportions. Solve some basic applied problems using the multiplication rule. We now come to the last of the four basic operations in developing our procedure for solving equations. We will also introduce ratio and proportion and use the multiplication rule to solve proportions. If each term of an equation is multiplied by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. In elementary arithmetic some of the most difficult operations are those involving fractions. The multiplication rule allows us to avoid these operations when solving an equation involving fractions by finding an equivalent equation that contains only whole numbers. Remember that when we multiply a whole number by a fraction, we use the rule We are now ready to solve an equation involving fractions. Note that in each case only the numerator of the fraction is multiplied by the whole number. Example 4 Solution Keep in mind that we wish to obtain x alone on one side of the equation. We also would like to obtain an equation in whole numbers that is equivalent to the given equation. To eliminate the fraction in the equation we need to multiply by a number that is divisible by the denominator 3. We thus use the multiplication rule and multiply each term of the equation by 3. We now have an equivalent equation that contains only whole numbers. Using the division rule, we obtain To eliminate the fraction we need to multiply by a number that is divisible by the denominator. In the example we need to multiply by a number that is divided by 3. We could have multiplied both sides by 6, 9, 12, and so on, but the equation is simpler and easier to work with if wc use the smallest multiple. Example 5 Solution See if you obtain the same solution by multiplying each side of the original equation by 16. Always check in the original equation. Example 6 Solution Here our task is the same but a little more complex. We have two fractions to eliminate. We must multiply each term of the equation by a number that is divisible by both 3 and 5. It is best to use the least of such numbers, which you will recall is the least common multiple . We will therefore multiply by 15. In arithmetic you may have referred to the least common multiple as the \"lowest common denominator.\" Example 7 Solution The least common multiple for 8 and 2 is 8, so we multiply each term of the equation by 8. We now use the subtraction rule. Finally the division rule gives us Before multiplying, change any mixed numbers to improper fractions. In this example change . Remember that each term must be multiplied by 8. Note that in this example we used three rules to find the solution. Solving simple equations by multiplying both sides by the same number occurs frequently in the study of ratio and proportion. A ratio is the quotient of two numbers. The ratio of a number x to a number y can be written as x:y or . In general, the fractional form is more meaningful and useful. Thus, we will write the ratio of 3 to 4 as . A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. Example 8 Solution We need to find a value of x such that the ratio of x to 15 is equal to the ratio of 2 to 5. Multiplying each side of the equation by 15, we obtain Why do we multiply both sides by 15? Check this solution in the original equation. Example 9 What number x has the same ratio to 3 as 6 has to 9? Solution To solve for x we first write the proportion: Next we multipy each side of the equation by 9. Say to yourself, \"2 is to 5 as x is to 10.\" Check! Example 11 The ratio of the number of women to the number of men in a math class is 7 to 8. If there are 24 men in the class, how many women are in the class? Solution Check! Example 12 Two sons were to divide an inheritance in the ratio of 3 to 5. If the son who received the larger portion got $20,000, what was the total amount of the inheritance? Solution We now add $20,000 + $12,000 to obtain the total amount of $32,000. Check! Again, be careful in setting up the proportion. In the ratio 3/5, 5 is the larger portion. Therefore, since $20,000 is the larger portion, it must also appear in the denominator. Example 13 If the legal requirements for room capacity require 3 cubic meters of air space per person, how many people can legally occupy a room that measures 6 meters wide, 8 meters long, and 3 meters high? Solution So, 48 people would be the legal room capacity. This means \"1 person is to 3 cubic meters as x people are to 144 cubic meters.\" Check the solution. COMBINING RULES FOR SOLVING EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use combinations of the various rules to solve more complex equations. Apply the orderly steps established in this section to systematically solve equations. Many of the exercises in previous sections have required the use of more than one rule in the solution process. In fact, it is possible that a single problem could involve all the rules There is no mandatory process for solving equations involving more than one rule, but experience has shown that the following order gives a smoother, more mistake-free procedure. First Eliminate fractions, if any, by multiplying each term of the equation by the least common multiple of all denominators of fractions in the equation. Second Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the equation. Third Add or subtract the necessary quantities to obtain the unknown quantity on one side and the numbers of arithmetic on the other side. Fourth Divide by the coefficient of the unknown quantity. Fifth Check your answer. Remember, the coefficient is the number being multiplied by the letter. (That is, in the expression 5x the coefficient is 5.) Again, make sure every term is\nmultiplied by 3. Solution Multiplying each term by 15 yields You may want to leave your answer as an improper fraction instead of a mixed number. Either form is correct, but the improper fraction form will be more useful in checking your solution. Note that there are four terms in this equation. Example 3 The selling price (S) of a certain article was $30.00. If the margin (M) was one-fifth of the cost (C), find the cost of the article. Use the formula C + M = S. Solution Since the margin was one-fifth of the cost, we may write SUMMARY Key Words An equation is a statement in symbols that two number expressions are equal. An identity is true for all values of the literal and arithmetic numbers in it. A conditional equation is true for only certain values of the literal numbers in it. A solution or root of an equation is the value of the variable that makes the equation a true statement. Two equations are equivalent if they have the same solution set. A ratio is the quotient of two numbers. A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. Procedures If each term of an equation is divided by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. If the same quantity is subtracted from both sides of an equation, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. If the same quantity is added to both sides of an equation, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. If each side of an equation is multiplied by the same nonzero number, the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation. To solve an equation follow these steps: Step 1 Eliminate fractions by multiplying each term by the least common multiple of all denominators in the equation. Step 2 Combine like terms on each side of the equation. Step 3 Add or subtract terms to obtain the unknown quantity on one side and the numbers of arithmetic on the other. Step 4 Divide each term by the coefficient of the unknown quantity. Step 5 Check your answer.

Algebra Tiles can be used to: recognize the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction e.g., since 5 + (–3) = 2, then 2 – (–3) = 5 recognize the inverse relationship between multiplication and division e.g., since (x + 1)(x + 2) = x 2 + 3x + 2, then (x 2 + 3x + 2) ÷ (x + 2) = (x + 1). solve equations by checking various substituted values Connecting Fundamental Math Concepts with mathies.ca (Draft) top Examples Integers Integers can be represented by using the 1 and -1 tiles (or segments). Arithmetical operations can be performed by manipulating two or more representations. A 1 tile can be dragged from the selection panel at the left onto the workspace. The multiplier button at the bottom right of the selection panel can be used to bring 1, 2, 5, or 10 tiles onto the workspace at a time. Existing tiles can be copied to create additional tiles in the workspace. If you select some 1 tiles, a negate button appears which can be used to change them to -1 tiles. Alternatively, the negate button at the bottom left of the selection panel can be used to show the opposites of tiles and segments in that panel, which can then be dragged to the workspace. In the example below, at the bottom of the workspace, the multiplication question 3 x (-4) is represented using an array model showing 3 rows of -4 tiles . The addition at the top of the workspace, 9 + (-5), can be performed by combining the nine 1 tiles and the five -1 tiles. Using the tool, select the five -1 tiles and move them on top of the nine 1 tiles, the tool will “poof” the five opposites, leaving four 1 tiles. Each 1 and -1 pairing is referred to as a \"zero pair\". If you open Sample File 1 and press the redo button twice , you will see the result of “poofing” the zero pairs. A legend is supplied to establish the colour being used for 1 and -1. These colours can be changed in the tool by: clicking on a tile or segment in the selection panel at the left and choosing a new colour from the palette. clicking the colour palette button at the top of the screen and choosing one of six common colour sets provided. Note: Settings are found by clicking the Gear icon , including a setting that: determines if zero pairs are automatically removed. changes the transparency of the background grid. The values panel at the bottom of the screen can be hidden (click the arrow to show/hide it again). The annotation tools on the right are shown by clicking the pencil icon and can be hidden or shown using the arrow on its panel. top Expressions Algebraic expressions can be represented using tiles or segments. Arithmetical operations can be performed by manipulating these representations. Expressions related to area and perimeter of rectangles can be modelled directly. Adding expressions can be thought of as combining tiles. In the example below, the tiles are combined in an order that allows them to be renamed as 8 x + 2 y + 4. This is a powerful visual image of what it means to 'simplify by collecting like terms'. Expressions can be evaluated at specific variable values. In the example above, a number line is used to measure the length of the rectangle after x has been set to 1.5 and y to 3. Notice that each x tile measures 1.5 on the number line and each y tile measures 3 units. The Summary dialog is shown when is clicked. Clicking on the dialog's Value tab will allow the work to be verified. The combined tiles are selected and the value of the selected tiles is listed as 22, which agrees with the measurement. Students might be asked to explain why the value of the total is twice as big as the selected and how the expression for the total reinforces that conclusion. See Sample File 2 . By default, opposite tiles poof (disappear) when combined, extending the \"zero-pair\" principle for Integers to algebraic terms. Students might be asked to represent 3x – 4 in at least six different ways. top Multiplying Polynomials Polynomials can be multiplied using an area model. A rectangle is formed with dimensions equal to the two factors. The product of the two factors is represented by the area of the rectangle and is expressed in terms of the variables in the dimensions, as in the two examples below. Segments can be used to create the dimensions of the rectangle to be filled in. Once the tiles are used to fill in the area, the values of the variables should be adjusted to show that the rectangular area represents the correct product for every value of the variable(s) not just specific instances. Then an expression for each product can be determined. Here the products are x 2 + 5 x + 6 and 2 x 2 + 7 xy + 6 y 2 . Students might be asked what is the same and different about the two multiplication questions. top Factoring Factoring is the inverse operation of multiplying in that the polynomial is expressed as a multiplication of two or more factors. When using an area model, this involves arranging the tiles representing the polynomial into a single rectangle. To do this with the Algebra Tiles tool, represent the polynomial then drag the tiles to form a single rectangle. Identify the dimensions of that rectangle as the factors of the polynomial. Once the rectangle is formed, segments can be used to mark off the dimensions which are used as factors in the result, (3 x + 2 y )(2 x + y ). The variable values should be adjusted to demonstrate that the factors are the same for rectangles of varying sizes. (If you open sample file 4 and click redo repeatedly, you will see this). top Solving Equations Equations can be represented using tiles or segments and solved by trial and error or by balancing. In the trial and error example below, the equation is modeled using segments. A number line from the annotation tools is used to mark off 10 units. The value of x is changed by sliding the controller on the workspace or in the values panel at the bottom of the screen, until the length is 10 units. (If you open sample file 5 and click redo, you will see this). A balance is drawn using the annotation tools, and tiles are used to represent the equation. Using the principle that equal quantities can be added or removed, 4 is removed from both sides (or -4 added and poofed). The six remaining unit tiles on the right are then arranged in 3 groups of 2 to match the left side in order to conclude that x = 2 (If you open sample file 5 and continue to click redo, you will see how this might be performed using the tool). In the example below, the equation x 2 = 18 is solved to find the principal square root of 18. The summary panel allows you to see the value of x 2 as x changes. Change the number of decimal places in the settings from 1 to 2 to 3 decimal places to get a finer and finer approximation. Trial and Error can also be used to solve a system of equations like: 2 x + y = 15, x + 3 y = 20 top Patterning and Functions Algebra tiles can be used to explore various patterns and related functions. For example, consider the expression ( x + 1) 2 . This expression can be represented using algebra tiles. This image shows the representation using the default value of x = 2.5. Physical manipulatives are designed using an x value of approximately 5.2. Both of these instances illustrate the expression at one particular value. However, the advantage of using the mathies Algebra Tiles tool is that the value of x can be adjusted. When x = 1, the representation is made up of 4 unit squares so the value of the expression is 4. How does the representation change as the value of x increases? Notice that for each value of x, the representation forms a square with side lengths ( x +1).\n\tAs the value of x changes, the side lengths change, the areas of the x and x 2 tiles change and the 1 tile remains constant. The value of the expression for each value can be determined algebraically and can be confirmed either by counting the grid squares or showing the value tab of the summary dialog . e.g., when x = 3, the value of the expression ( x + 1) 2 is 16. Each of these representations can be thought of as a term of a pattern or a point on a graph.\n\tThe annotation tools can be used to created a table of values and/or a graph. The function y = ( x + 1) 2 is of course a continuous function. Values in between the integral points can also be illustrated using the tool. top Sample Files To access a sample file: click the link in the Sample column (desktop only), or use the Open WWW button in the Settings dialog and supply the URL, or download the file from the URL column (right-click and save locally on desktop, hard tap on mobile) and use the Open button in the tool. add the mathies sample files Google drive folder to \"My Drive\" which allows convenient access on all devices.

Students will develop their mental math skills with\n\t\t\tAlgebra Tiles as they: solve problems involving the addition, subtraction and multiplication of integers and polynomials relate factoring to division of polynomials Developing proficiency with operations: Performing calculations with ease, precision, and consistency and with a general understanding of number and operations, number properties, and their appropriate application in problem solving. Algebra Tiles can be used to: recognize the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction e.g., since 5 + (–3) = 2, then 2 – (–3) = 5 recognize the inverse relationship between multiplication and division e.g., since (x + 1)(x + 2) = x 2 + 3x + 2, then (x 2 + 3x + 2) ÷ (x + 2) = (x + 1). solve equations by checking various substituted values Connecting Fundamental Math Concepts with mathies.ca (Draft) top Examples Integers Integers can be represented by using the 1 and -1 tiles (or segments). Arithmetical operations can be performed by manipulating two or more representations. A 1 tile can be dragged from the selection panel at the left onto the workspace. The multiplier button at the bottom right of the selection panel can be used to bring 1, 2, 5, or 10 tiles onto the workspace at a time. Existing tiles can be copied to create additional tiles in the workspace. If you select some 1 tiles, a negate button appears which can be used to change them to -1 tiles. Alternatively, the negate button at the bottom left of the selection panel can be used to show the opposites of tiles and segments in that panel, which can then be dragged to the workspace. In the example below, at the bottom of the workspace, the multiplication question 3 x (-4) is represented using an array model showing 3 rows of -4 tiles . The addition at the top of the workspace, 9 + (-5), can be performed by combining the nine 1 tiles and the five -1 tiles. Using the tool, select the five -1 tiles and move them on top of the nine 1 tiles, the tool will “poof” the five opposites, leaving four 1 tiles. Each 1 and -1 pairing is referred to as a \"zero pair\". If you open Sample File 1 and press the redo button twice , you will see the result of “poofing” the zero pairs. A legend is supplied to establish the colour being used for 1 and -1. These colours can be changed in the tool by: clicking on a tile or segment in the selection panel at the left and choosing a new colour from the palette. clicking the colour palette button at the top of the screen and choosing one of six common colour sets provided. Note: Settings are found by clicking the Gear icon , including a setting that: determines if zero pairs are automatically removed. changes the transparency of the background grid. The values panel at the bottom of the screen can be hidden (click the arrow to show/hide it again). The annotation tools on the right are shown by clicking the pencil icon and can be hidden or shown using the arrow on its panel. top Expressions Algebraic expressions can be represented using tiles or segments. Arithmetical operations can be performed by manipulating these representations. Expressions related to area and perimeter of rectangles can be modelled directly. Adding expressions can be thought of as combining tiles. In the example below, the tiles are combined in an order that allows them to be renamed as 8 x + 2 y + 4. This is a powerful visual image of what it means to 'simplify by collecting like terms'. Expressions can be evaluated at specific variable values. In the example above, a number line is used to measure the length of the rectangle after x has been set to 1.5 and y to 3. Notice that each x tile measures 1.5 on the number line and each y tile measures 3 units. The Summary dialog is shown when is clicked. Clicking on the dialog's Value tab will allow the work to be verified. The combined tiles are selected and the value of the selected tiles is listed as 22, which agrees with the measurement. Students might be asked to explain why the value of the total is twice as big as the selected and how the expression for the total reinforces that conclusion. See Sample File 2 . By default, opposite tiles poof (disappear) when combined, extending the \"zero-pair\" principle for Integers to algebraic terms. Students might be asked to represent 3x – 4 in at least six different ways. top Multiplying Polynomials Polynomials can be multiplied using an area model. A rectangle is formed with dimensions equal to the two factors. The product of the two factors is represented by the area of the rectangle and is expressed in terms of the variables in the dimensions, as in the two examples below. Segments can be used to create the dimensions of the rectangle to be filled in. Once the tiles are used to fill in the area, the values of the variables should be adjusted to show that the rectangular area represents the correct product for every value of the variable(s) not just specific instances. Then an expression for each product can be determined. Here the products are x 2 + 5 x + 6 and 2 x 2 + 7 xy + 6 y 2 . Students might be asked what is the same and different about the two multiplication questions. top Factoring Factoring is the inverse operation of multiplying in that the polynomial is expressed as a multiplication of two or more factors. When using an area model, this involves arranging the tiles representing the polynomial into a single rectangle. To do this with the Algebra Tiles tool, represent the polynomial then drag the tiles to form a single rectangle. Identify the dimensions of that rectangle as the factors of the polynomial. Once the rectangle is formed, segments can be used to mark off the dimensions which are used as factors in the result, (3 x + 2 y )(2 x + y ). The variable values should be adjusted to demonstrate that the factors are the same for rectangles of varying sizes. (If you open sample file 4 and click redo repeatedly, you will see this). top Solving Equations Equations can be represented using tiles or segments and solved by trial and error or by balancing. In the trial and error example below, the equation is modeled using segments. A number line from the annotation tools is used to mark off 10 units. The value of x is changed by sliding the controller on the workspace or in the values panel at the bottom of the screen, until the length is 10 units. (If you open sample file 5 and click redo, you will see this). A balance is drawn using the annotation tools, and tiles are used to represent the equation. Using the principle that equal quantities can be added or removed, 4 is removed from both sides (or -4 added and poofed). The six remaining unit tiles on the right are then arranged in 3 groups of 2 to match the left side in order to conclude that x = 2 (If you open sample file 5 and continue to click redo, you will see how this might be performed using the tool). In the example below, the equation x 2 = 18 is solved to find the principal square root of 18. The summary panel allows you to see the value of x 2 as x changes. Change the number of decimal places in the settings from 1 to 2 to 3 decimal places to get a finer and finer approximation. Trial and Error can also be used to solve a system of equations like: 2 x + y = 15, x + 3 y = 20 top Patterning and Functions Algebra tiles can be used to explore various patterns and related functions. For example, consider the expression ( x + 1) 2 . This expression can be represented using algebra tiles. This image shows the representation using the default value of x = 2.5. Physical manipulatives are designed using an x value of approximately 5.2. Both of these instances illustrate the expression at one particular value. However, the advantage of using the mathies Algebra Tiles tool is that the value of x can be adjusted. When x = 1, the representation is made up of 4 unit squares so the value of the expression is 4. How does the representation change as the value of x increases? Notice that for each value of x, the representation forms a square with side lengths ( x +1).\n\tAs the value of x changes, the side lengths change, the areas of the x and x 2 tiles change and the 1 tile remains constant. The value of the expression for each value can be determined algebraically and can be confirmed either by counting the grid squares or showing the value tab of the summary dialog . e.g., when x = 3, the value of the expression ( x + 1) 2 is 16. Each of these representations can be thought of as a term of a pattern or a point on a graph.\n\tThe annotation tools can be used to created a table of values and/or a graph. The function y = ( x + 1) 2 is of course a continuous function. Values in between the integral points can also be illustrated using the tool. top Sample Files To access a sample file: click the link in the Sample column (desktop only), or use the Open WWW button in the Settings dialog and supply the URL, or download the file from the URL column (right-click and save locally on desktop, hard tap on mobile) and use the Open button in the tool. add the mathies sample files Google drive folder to \"My Drive\" which allows convenient access on all devices.

A\ncrystal is composed of many cells or lattices, in which the atoms\nare arranged. In the field of metallurgy, a crystal is often called\na grain. unit cell structures or lattices are found in nature. However most metals and many other solids have unit cell structures described as body center cubic (bcc), face centered cubic (fcc) or Hexagonal Close Packed (hcp). Since these structures are most common, they will be discussed in more detail. Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Structure The body-centered cubic unit cell has atoms at each of the eight corners of a cube (like the cubic unit cell) plus one atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. in the center of the cube (left image below). Each of the corner atoms is the corner of another cube so the corner atoms are shared among eight unit cells. It is said to have a coordination number of 8. The bcc unit cell consists of a net total of two atoms; one in the center and eight eighths from corners atoms as shown in the middle image below (middle image below). The image below highlights a unit cell in a larger section of the lattice. The bcc arrangement does not allow the atoms to pack together as closely as the fcc or hcp arrangements. The bcc structure is often the high temperature form of metals that are close-packed at lower temperatures. The volume of atoms in a cell per the total volume of a cell is called the packing factor . The bcc unit cell has a packing factor of 0.68. Some of the materials that have a bcc structure include lithium, sodium, potassium, chromium, barium, vanadium, alpha-iron and tungsten Tungsten - A metal\ncommonly used to make the plugs used for connecting metal wires to\none another or to the devices in integrated\ncircuits. . Metals which have a bcc structure are usually harder and less malleable than close-packed metals such as gold. When the metal Metal - An opaque, lustrous\nelemental chemical substance that is a good conductor of heat and\nelectricity and, when polished, a good reflector of light. Most\nelemental metals are malleable and ductile and are, in general,\nheavier than the other elemental substances. is deformed, the planes of atoms must slip over each other, and this is more difficult in the bcc structure. It should be noted that there are other important mechanisms for hardening materials, such as introducing impurities Impurities - Elements or\ncompounds whose presence in a material is\nundesired. or defects which make slipping more difficult. These hardening mechanisms will be discussed latter. Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure The face centered cubic structure has atoms located at each of the corners and the centers of all the cubic faces (left image below). Each of the corner atoms is the corner of another cube so the corner atoms are shared among eight unit cells. Additionally, each of its six face centered atoms is shared with an adjacent atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. . Since 12 of its atoms are shared, it is said to have a coordination number of 12. The fcc unit cell consists of a net total of four atoms; eight eighths from corners atoms and six halves of the face atoms as shown in the middle image above. The image below highlights a unit cell in a larger section of the lattice. In the fcc structure (and the hcp structure) the atoms can pack closer together than they can in the bcc structure. The atoms from one layer nest themselves in the empty space between the atoms of the adjacent layer. To picture packing arrangement, imagine a box filled with a layer of balls that are aligned in columns and rows. When a few additional balls are tossed in the box, they will not balance directly on top of the balls in the first layer but instead will come to rest in the pocket created between four balls of the bottom layer. As more balls are added they will pack together to fill up all the pockets. The packing factor (the volume of atoms in a cell per the total volume of a cell) is 0.74 for fcc crystals. Some of the metals that have the fcc structure include aluminum, copper, gold, iridium, lead, nickel, platinum and silver. Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) Structure Another common close packed structure is the hexagonal close pack. The hexagonal structure of alternating layers is shifted so its atoms are aligned to the gaps of the preceding layer. The atoms from one layer nest themselves in the empty space between the atoms of the adjacent layer just like in the fcc structure. However, instead of being a cubic structure, the pattern is hexagonal. (See image below.) The difference between the HCP and FCC structure is discussed later in this section. The hcp structure has three layers of atoms. In each the top and bottom layer, there are six atoms that arrange themselves in the shape of a hexagon and a seventh atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. that sits in the middle of the hexagon. The middle layer has three atoms nestle in the triangular \"grooves\" of the top and bottom plane. Note that there are six of these \"grooves\" surrounding each atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. in the hexagonal plane, but only three of them can be filled by atoms. As shown in the middle image above, there are six atoms in the hcp unit cell. Each of the 12 atoms in the corners of the top and bottom layers contribute 1/6 atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. to the unit cell, the two atoms in the center of the hexagon of both the top and bottom layers each contribute one half atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. and each of the three atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. in the middle layer contribute 1 atom Atom - The smallest\nparticle of any element that still retains the characteristics of\nthat element. All matter such as solids, liquids, and gases, is\ncomposed of atoms. . The image on the right above attempts to show several hcp unit cells in a larger lattice. The coordination number of the atoms in this structure is 12. There are six nearest neighbors in the same close packed layer, three in the layer above and three in the layer below. The packing factor is 0.74, which is the same as the fcc unit cell. The hcp structure is very common for elemental metals and some examples include beryllium, cadmium, magnesium, titanium, zinc and zirconium. xx yy",

Or you can find the\n chi-square statistic associated with a specified cumulative probability. If anything is unclear, read the Frequently-Asked Questions or the Sample Problems .\n To learn more about the chi-square, read Stat Trek's tutorial on the chi-square distribution . Enter value for degrees of freedom. Enter a value for one, and only one, of the other textboxes. Click Calculate to compute a value for the remaining textbox. Degrees of freedom Chi-square value (x) Probability: P(χ 2 ≤x) Probability: P(χ 2 ≤x) Frequently-Asked Questions Calculator | Sample Problems Instructions: To find the answer to a frequently-asked \n\t question, simply click on the question. What are degrees of freedom? Degrees of freedom can be described as the number of scores that \n\t are free to vary. For example, suppose you tossed three dice. The total score \n\t adds up to 12. If you rolled a 3 on the first die and a 5 on the second, then \n\t you know that the third die must be a 4 (otherwise, the total would not add up \n\t to 12). In this example, 2 die are free to vary while the third is not. \n\t Therefore, there are 2 degrees of freedom. In many situations, the degrees of freedom are equal to the \n\t number of observations minus one. Thus, if the sample size were 20, there would \n\t be 20 observations; the degrees of freedom would be 20 minus 1 or 19. What is a chi-square critical value? The chi-square critical value (x) can be any number between \n zero and plus infinity.\n The chi-square calculator computes the probability that a chi-square statistic (χ 2 )\n falls between 0 and the critical value. Suppose you randomly select a sample of 10 \n observations from a large population. \n In this example, the degrees of freedom (df) would be 9, \n since df = n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9. \n Suppose you wanted to find the probability that a chi-square statistic falls between\n 0 and 13. In the chi-square calculator, you would enter 9 for degrees of freedom\n and 13 for the chi-square value. Then, after you click the Calculate button, the \n calculator would show the cumulative probability to be 0.84. That is, P(χ 2 ≤13) = 0.84. What is a cumulative probability? A cumulative probability is a sum of probabilities. \n The chi-square calculator computes two cumulative probabilities: P(χ 2 ≤ x): The probability that a \n chi-square statistic falls between 0 and some critical value (x). P(χ 2 ≥ x): The probability that a \n chi-square statistic falls between some critical value (x) and plus infinity. What is a chi-square statistic? A chi-square statistic (χ 2 ) is a statistic whose values are given by χ 2 = [ ( n - 1 ) \n\t * s 2 ] / σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of \n\t the population, s is the standard deviation of the sample, and n is the sample \n\t size. The distribution of the chi-square statistic has n - 1 degrees of \n\t freedom. (For more on the chi-square statistic, see the tutorial on the chi-square distribution .) What is a probability? A probability is a number expressing the chances that a specific \n\t event will occur. This number can take on any value from 0 to 1. A probability \n\t of 0 means that there is zero chance that the event will occur; a probability \n\t of 1 means that the event is certain to occur. Numbers between 0 and 1 quantify \n\t the uncertainty associated with the event. For example, the probability of a \n\t coin flip resulting in Heads (rather than Tails) would be 0.50. Fifty percent \n\t of the time, the coin flip would result in Heads; and fifty percent of the \n\t time, it would result in Tails. Sample Problems Calculator | Frequently-Asked Questions The Acme Widget Company claims that their widgets last 5 \n\t\t years, with a standard deviation of 1 year. Assume that their claims are true. If you test a random sample of 9 Acme widgets, what is the probability that the \n\t\t standard deviation in your sample will be less than 0.95 years? Solution: We know the following: The population standard deviation is equal to 1. The sample standard deviation is equal to 0.95. The sample size (n) is equal to 9. The degrees of freedom (df) is equal to 8, because df = n - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8. Given these data, we compute the chi-square statistic: χ 2 = [ ( n - 1 ) \n\t\t\t * s 2 ] / σ 2 χ 2 = [ ( 9 - 1 ) \n\t\t\t * (0.95) 2 ] / (1.0) 2 = 7.22 where σ is the standard deviation of the population, \n\t\t s is the standard deviation of the sample, and n is the sample size. Now, using the Chi-Square Distribution \n\t\t\t Calculator , we can determine the cumulative probability for the chi-square statistic. We enter the \n\t\t degrees of freedom (8) and the chi-square critical value (7.22) into the calculator, \n\t\t and hit the Calculate button. The calculator reports that the P(χ 2 ≤ 7.22)\n is 0.48691. Therefore, there is about a 49% chance that the sample standard deviation will be no more than 0.95. Find the chi-square critical value, if the P(χ 2 ≤ x) is 0.75 and the sample size is 25. Solution: We know the following: The P(χ 2 ≤ x) is 0.75. The sample size (n) is 25. The degrees of freedom (df) is equal to 24,because df = n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24. Given these data, we compute the chi-square critical value, using the Chi-Square Distribution Calculator . We enter the degrees of freedom \n\t\t (24) and the cumulative probability (0.75) into the calculator, and hit the \n\t\t Calculate button. The calculator reports that the chi-square critical value is \n\t\t 28.24115. This means that if you select a random sample of 25 observations, there is \n\t\t a 75% chance that the chi-square statistic from that sample will be less than\n\t\t or equal to 28.24115. Problem?

What are degrees of freedom? Degrees of freedom can be described as the number of scores that \n\t are free to vary. For example, suppose you tossed three dice. The total score \n\t adds up to 12. If you rolled a 3 on the first die and a 5 on the second, then \n\t you know that the third die must be a 4 (otherwise, the total would not add up \n\t to 12). In this example, 2 die are free to vary while the third is not. \n\t Therefore, there are 2 degrees of freedom. In many situations, the degrees of freedom are equal to the \n\t number of observations minus one. Thus, if the sample size were 20, there would \n\t be 20 observations; the degrees of freedom would be 20 minus 1 or 19. What is a chi-square critical value? The chi-square critical value (x) can be any number between \n zero and plus infinity.\n The chi-square calculator computes the probability that a chi-square statistic (χ 2 )\n falls between 0 and the critical value. Suppose you randomly select a sample of 10 \n observations from a large population. \n In this example, the degrees of freedom (df) would be 9, \n since df = n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9. \n Suppose you wanted to find the probability that a chi-square statistic falls between\n 0 and 13. In the chi-square calculator, you would enter 9 for degrees of freedom\n and 13 for the chi-square value. Then, after you click the Calculate button, the \n calculator would show the cumulative probability to be 0.84. That is, P(χ 2 ≤13) = 0.84. What is a cumulative probability? A cumulative probability is a sum of probabilities. \n The chi-square calculator computes two cumulative probabilities: P(χ 2 ≤ x): The probability that a \n chi-square statistic falls between 0 and some critical value (x). P(χ 2 ≥ x): The probability that a \n chi-square statistic falls between some critical value (x) and plus infinity. What is a chi-square statistic? A chi-square statistic (χ 2 ) is a statistic whose values are given by χ 2 = [ ( n - 1 ) \n\t * s 2 ] / σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of \n\t the population, s is the standard deviation of the sample, and n is the sample \n\t size. The distribution of the chi-square statistic has n - 1 degrees of \n\t freedom. (For more on the chi-square statistic, see the tutorial on the chi-square distribution .) What is a probability? A probability is a number expressing the chances that a specific \n\t event will occur. This number can take on any value from 0 to 1. A probability \n\t of 0 means that there is zero chance that the event will occur; a probability \n\t of 1 means that the event is certain to occur.

Charges of the same kind repel each other, charges of different kinds attract. The forces between charges get weaker as the charges get farther apart. The direction of the force between charges is along the line from one to the other. From our work with the Newtonian theoretical framework , we also expect The forces two charges exert on each other should be equal and opposite (satisfy Newton's 3rd law ). In this webpage, we will elaborate these four ideas to create a model of electric force that both encompasses these qualitative ideas and allows us to quantify electric forces so that we can use them in Newton's 2nd law . The critical idea seems to be charge. We first have to answer some questions about charge: What is it? How does it behave? And what mathematical model is appropriate for describing it? Quantifying charge \"Charge\" is what we are calling that property of the basic particles of matter -- electrons and protons -- that create and feel the electric force. One basic fact that is easily demonstrated is: The electrical effects of an electron and a proton on other charged particles are opposite to each other and equal in strength. This is why atoms with the same number of electrons and protons don't seem to have obvious electric effects. Since they seem to cancel and be equal, it seems that a natural way to assign a number to charge is to count the number of protons and subtract the number of electrons. The total effect of neutral matter would be zero and observable effects would come from having an excess of one or another. (We are temporarily assuming all these charges are pretty much in the same place so we are ignoring polarization effects for now, since they are much smaller than the electrical effects from unbalanced charges -- though polarization does turn out often to be important!) One way to assign a number to the charge on an object is just to count. A plausible way to quantify charge would be to assign the number: Q = (number of protons) - (number of electrons). Unfortunately, we don't do this. Electrical forces were analyzed and the theory worked out in the last half of the 18th century.  The understanding of matter as made up of atoms didn't come till almost 100 years later and the understanding of atoms as made up of electrons and protons not till 50 years after that. As a result, the scale for measuring charge was based on other things. The result is the standard unit for charge is taken to be the Coulomb: 1 Coulomb = the charge on 6.24 x 10 18 protons. Actually, it seems rather reasonable to do this, since counting up to 10 18 protons might take us a very long time! But since we have a new arbitrary measurement scale, we can assign a new dimension to go with M, L, and T (mass, length, and time). We'll call it \"Q\".  It will turn out to be quite convenient for checking and proposing new electrical equations using dimensional analysis. Since we are going to use \"Coulombs\" instead of counting protons and electrons, it's useful to introduce the number that is the value of the amount of charge on an electron or proton in our Coulomb unit.  This is just the reciprocal of the number of charges in a Coulomb: e = the magnitude of the charge on a proton or electron = 1.6 x 10 -19 Coulombs. Creating the force law How does the force depend on the charge? First, let's ask ourselves how the force between two charges must depend on the magnitude of the charges.  We've drawn a sketch of two charges, labeled Q and q , separated by a distance r .  Just for convenience, we'll talk about them as if they are positive. (When we get to talk about how vectors go into the law, we'll worry about whether it works for negative charges too.)  For two positive charges, the forces they exert on each other tend to push them apart. We have labeled the force each charge feels from the other.  By N3, we expect them to be equal and opposite. (In this diagram, since we haven't put arrows over the symbols, the symbols for the forces only refer to magnitudes of the forces). In the second diagram, we've now asked what would happen if we put a second charge, q, on top of the first.  First of all, we'd expect that charge q would feel the same electric force from Q that the original one did.  So if we lumped these two charges together, considering them a single charge of amount 2q, we expect that the force that 2q would feel from any other charge would be twice what a q charge would feel. This suggests that the force that a charge feels should be proportional to the amount of charge feeling the force. If we now look at what has happened to Q, it should feel the force from the original charge q, but it should feel an equal amount of force from the second charge, q.  So the force that Q would feel from a charge of 2q should be twice the charge that it feels from a charge q alone. This suggests that the force that a charge causes should be proportional to the amount of charge causing the force. Our first conclusion is therefore that when two charges exert electric forces on each other, the magnitude of the force each one exerts on the other is proportional to ( ∝ ) the product of the two charges. F E q → Q = F E Q → q ∝ q Q Note that we have no vectors over the symbols so we are only talking about the magnitude of the forces. How does the force depend on the distance? Now we have to get the distance dependence.  We know it gets weaker, but how?  This can be determined simply by experiment.*  The result is that the force between the two charges falls off like the square of the distance between them. F E q → Q = F E Q → q ∝ q Q r 2 q Q We've been careful to label the \" r \" to show that we mean the distance between the two charges. Do we need a constant? Now we have to decide if we're done or if we need to put anything else in.  By looking at the dimensions it's clear that we have a problem.  The left side of the equation has dimensionality of force: [ F ] = ML/T 2 while the right side has something else: [ q Q r 2 ] = Q 2 /L 2 It has our new dimensionality, Q in it and is missing other factors. So let's introduce a \"universal constant with units\".  This is typically what we have to do when we introduce new arbitrary measurement scales (here, charge) without really knowing how they relate to other things we have already defined.  These constants are an indication that we didn't know enough physics at the time to define what charge \"really\" is.  (There is a system of measurement that defines charge in terms of the already existing M, L, and T measurements, but it didn't catch on.) So our final law is going to be (for the magnitudes of the forces) F E q → Q = F E Q → q = k C q Q r 2 q Q This result is called Coulomb's law of electric forces and the constant k C is called Coulomb's constant. Sometimes you'll see it written as K, and sometimes (for peculiar historical reasons) as 1 4 π ϵ 0 . (Sorry about that.**) Since you will actually sometime see this in more advanced biology texts, we give the value here, but we'll stick with Coulomb's constant for this class -- and will write it in the easy to remember form k C = 9 x 10 9 N-m 2 /C 2 (good to about 0.1%).  Notice that the units of this are just those needed to cancel the charge squared in Coulombs (C) on the top and the meters (m) squared on the bottom to give Newtons (N). k C = 8.99 x 10 9 N-m 2 /C 2 ϵ 0 = 8.85 x 10 -12 C 2 /N-m 2 We now have to pay attention to the vector character of the law. Go to the follow-ons to get more insight into the structure of the law. *It's tempting to notice that the area of a sphere surrounding a charge grows like r 2 as the radius of the sphere grows. If one is trying to create a theory of electric forces, it would be quite natural to say that the charge \"emits\" something that can be felt as a force by another charge and it \"thins out\" as you go further away by being spread out over all directions -- over the surface of the sphere surrounding the charge. ** It also makes some of the more advanced equations of electromagnetism slightly simpler.

In the second diagram, we've now asked what would happen if we put a second charge, q, on top of the first.  First of all, we'd expect that charge q would feel the same electric force from Q that the original one did.  So if we lumped these two charges together, considering them a single charge of amount 2q, we expect that the force that 2q would feel from any other charge would be twice what a q charge would feel. This suggests that the force that a charge feels should be proportional to the amount of charge feeling the force. If we now look at what has happened to Q, it should feel the force from the original charge q, but it should feel an equal amount of force from the second charge, q.  So the force that Q would feel from a charge of 2q should be twice the charge that it feels from a charge q alone. This suggests that the force that a charge causes should be proportional to the amount of charge causing the force. Our first conclusion is therefore that when two charges exert electric forces on each other, the magnitude of the force each one exerts on the other is proportional to ( ∝ ) the product of the two charges. F E q → Q = F E Q → q ∝ q Q Note that we have no vectors over the symbols so we are only talking about the magnitude of the forces. How does the force depend on the distance? Now we have to get the distance dependence.  We know it gets weaker, but how?  This can be determined simply by experiment.*  The result is that the force between the two charges falls off like the square of the distance between them. F E q → Q = F E Q → q ∝ q Q r 2 q Q We've been careful to label the \" r \" to show that we mean the distance between the two charges. Do we need a constant? Now we have to decide if we're done or if we need to put anything else in.  By looking at the dimensions it's clear that we have a problem.  The left side of the equation has dimensionality of force: [ F ] = ML/T 2 while the right side has something else: [ q Q r 2 ] = Q 2 /L 2 It has our new dimensionality, Q in it and is missing other factors. So let's introduce a \"universal constant with units\".  This is typically what we have to do when we introduce new arbitrary measurement scales (here, charge) without really knowing how they relate to other things we have already defined.  These constants are an indication that we didn't know enough physics at the time to define what charge \"really\" is.  (There is a system of measurement that defines charge in terms of the already existing M, L, and T measurements, but it didn't catch on.) So our final law is going to be (for the magnitudes of the forces) F E q → Q = F E Q → q = k C q Q r 2 q Q This result is called Coulomb's law of electric forces and the constant k C is called Coulomb's constant. Sometimes you'll see it written as K, and sometimes (for peculiar historical reasons) as 1 4 π ϵ 0 . (Sorry about that.**) Since you will actually sometime see this in more advanced biology texts, we give the value here, but we'll stick with Coulomb's constant for this class -- and will write it in the easy to remember form k C = 9 x 10 9 N-m 2 /C 2 (good to about 0.1%).  Notice that the units of this are just those needed to cancel the charge squared in Coulombs (C) on the top and the meters (m) squared on the bottom to give Newtons (N). k C = 8.99 x 10 9 N-m 2 /C 2 ϵ 0 = 8.85 x 10 -12 C 2 /N-m 2 We now have to pay attention to the vector character of the law. Go to the follow-ons to get more insight into the structure of the law. *It's tempting to notice that the area of a sphere surrounding a charge grows like r 2 as the radius of the sphere grows. If one is trying to create a theory of electric forces, it would be quite natural to say that the charge \"emits\" something that can be felt as a force by another charge and it \"thins out\" as you go further away by being spread out over all directions -- over the surface of the sphere surrounding the charge. ** It also makes some of the more advanced equations of electromagnetism slightly simpler.

From: millimeter To: inch Millimeter Definition: A millimeter (symbol: mm) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined in terms of the meter, as 1/1000 of a meter, or the distance traveled by light in 1/299 792 458 000 of a second. History/origin: The milli- prefix is one of many metric prefixes. It indicates one thousandth of the base unit, in this case the meter. The definition of the meter has changed over time, the current definition being based on the distance traveled by the speed of light in a given amount of time. The relationship between the meter and the millimeter is constant however. Prior to this definition, the meter was based on the length of a prototype meter bar. In 2019, the meter has been re-defined based on the changes made to the definition of a second. Inch Definition: An inch (symbol: in) is a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems of measurement. An inch was defined to be equivalent to exactly 25.4 millimeters in 1959. There are 12 inches in a foot and 36 inches in a yard. History/origin: The term \"inch\" was derived from the Latin unit \"uncia\" which equated to \"one-twelfth\" of a Roman foot. There have been a number of different standards for the inch in the past, with the current definition being based on the international yard. One of the earliest definitions of the inch was based on barleycorns, where an inch was equal to the length of three grains of dry, round barley placed end-to-end. Another version of the inch is also believed to have been derived from the width of a human thumb, where the length was obtained from averaging the width of three thumbs: a small, a medium, and a large one. Current use: The inch is mostly used in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It is also sometimes used in Japan (as well as other countries) in relation to electronic parts, like the size of display screens.

Regardless of how much of it there is, or what shape it’s in, a material will always have the same density. Knowing the density of an item can help identify what something is made out of or where it came from. The density of any material is determined by the ratio of its mass and volume. Represented mathematically: d = m/V Where d is the density, measured in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm 3 ), m is the mass, measured in grams (g), and V is the volume, measured in cubic centimeters (cm 3 ). Another common way to measure density is in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m 3 ), which is simply 1000 times the same density at g/cm 3 . To measure the density of an unknown material, you will need to find the mass and the volume. The mass can be found by using an electronic scale or spring balance. The volume can be measured by approximating the dimensions of an object, but a more reliable method is by using water displacement. Measure the volume of water poured into a graduated cylinder, then place the object in the water and remeasure the volume. The difference between the two volume measurements is the volume of the object. Now simply divide the mass by the volume to calculate the density of the object. You can compare this density to a table of common materials to see if it matches up with any of them.

Adverbs - Video Lesson Types of Adverbs How Are Adverbs Different from Adjectives? How to Form Adverbs The Number One Function of an Adverb Other Functions of Adverbs Adverbs - Quiz What Is an Adverb? An adverb is a word that describes or gives more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or a whole sentence. Examples: Cora finished lunch quickly . (The adverb \"quickly\" modifies the verb \"finished\".) Ryan is too fat. (The adverb \"too\" modifies the adjective \"fat\".) Maya spoke quite excitedly. (The adverb \"quite\" modifies another adverb \"excitedly\".) Thankfully , tomorrow is a holiday. (The adverb \"thankfully\" modifies the sentence \"Tomorrow is a holiday\".) Types of Adverbs Adverbs of Manner In simple words, adverbs of manner tell us how an action happens. Example: Martin spoke slowly . (The adverb \"slowly\" tell us how or the manner in which Martin spoke.) Adverbs of Place An adverb of place tells us where an action happens. Example: Martha studied here . (The adverb \"here\" tells us where or the place in which Martha studied.) Adverbs of Time An adverb of time tells us when an action happens. Example: Dad is traveling next week . (The adverb \"next week\" tells us when or the time in which Dad is traveling.) Adverbs of Duration An adverb of duration tells us for how long an action happens. Adverbs of duration mostly contain one of the two words: since or for. Example: We have been on holidays for a week . (The adverb “for a week” tells for how long we have been on holidays.) Adverbs of Frequency An adverb of frequency tells us how often an action happens. Example: We go to the movies once in a week . (The adverb “once in a week” tells how often we go to the movies.) Adverbs of Degree An adverb of degree tells us about the degree or intensity of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Example: I have almost finished the work. (The adverb “almost” tells how much I have finished work.) Click on the Circles to Spot the Six Adverbs good excitedly massive swiftly big funnily boringly generously gently tasty Reset How Are Adverbs Different from Adjectives? While an adjective describes a noun, an adverb can describe a verb, adjective, clause, or another adverb. In other words, adverbs have a wider scope than adjectives. Examples: This is a beautiful dress. (adjective) The dress is designed beautifully . (adverb) How to Form Adverbs Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives. Examples: quick - quickly wise - wisely Adjectives ending with -y are made adverbs by changing -y to -ily. Example: happy - happily Adjectives ending with -able or -ible are made adverbs by changing -e to -y. Examples: approachable - approachable horrible - horribly Adjectives ending with -c are made adverbs by changing -c to -cally. Example: ironic - ironically The Number One Function of an Adverb The most popular role of an adverb is to describe a verb. We find this function of adverbs in nearly every sentence that we read or hear. Examples: The job was done easily . Aunt Julia left early this time. Other Functions of Adverbs Adverbs Describing Adjectives Adverbs are often used to describe adjectives. Examples: This is a very good movie. Sandra worked at an amazingly fast pace. Adverbs Describing Other Adverbs It's not unusual for an adverb to modify another adverb in a sentence. Example: Kiara went through the book fairly quickly. Adverbs Describing Clauses Interestingly, adverbs can sometimes be used to describe an entire clause. Example: Remarkably , China was at the top of the list. Take an Adverb Quiz Now!

How to Form Adverbs The Number One Function of an Adverb Other Functions of Adverbs Adverbs - Quiz What Is an Adverb? An adverb is a word that describes or gives more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or a whole sentence. Examples: Cora finished lunch quickly . (The adverb \"quickly\" modifies the verb \"finished\".) Ryan is too fat. (The adverb \"too\" modifies the adjective \"fat\".) Maya spoke quite excitedly. (The adverb \"quite\" modifies another adverb \"excitedly\".) Thankfully , tomorrow is a holiday. (The adverb \"thankfully\" modifies the sentence \"Tomorrow is a holiday\".) Types of Adverbs Adverbs of Manner In simple words, adverbs of manner tell us how an action happens. Example: Martin spoke slowly . (The adverb \"slowly\" tell us how or the manner in which Martin spoke.) Adverbs of Place An adverb of place tells us where an action happens. Example: Martha studied here . (The adverb \"here\" tells us where or the place in which Martha studied.) Adverbs of Time An adverb of time tells us when an action happens. Example: Dad is traveling next week . (The adverb \"next week\" tells us when or the time in which Dad is traveling.) Adverbs of Duration An adverb of duration tells us for how long an action happens. Adverbs of duration mostly contain one of the two words: since or for. Example: We have been on holidays for a week . (The adverb “for a week” tells for how long we have been on holidays.) Adverbs of Frequency An adverb of frequency tells us how often an action happens. Example: We go to the movies once in a week . (The adverb “once in a week” tells how often we go to the movies.) Adverbs of Degree An adverb of degree tells us about the degree or intensity of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Example: I have almost finished the work. (The adverb “almost” tells how much I have finished work.) Click on the Circles to Spot the Six Adverbs good excitedly massive swiftly big funnily boringly generously gently tasty Reset How Are Adverbs Different from Adjectives? While an adjective describes a noun, an adverb can describe a verb, adjective, clause, or another adverb. In other words, adverbs have a wider scope than adjectives. Examples: This is a beautiful dress. (adjective) The dress is designed beautifully . (adverb) How to Form Adverbs Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives. Examples: quick - quickly wise - wisely Adjectives ending with -y are made adverbs by changing -y to -ily. Example: happy - happily Adjectives ending with -able or -ible are made adverbs by changing -e to -y. Examples: approachable - approachable horrible - horribly Adjectives ending with -c are made adverbs by changing -c to -cally. Example: ironic - ironically The Number One Function of an Adverb The most popular role of an adverb is to describe a verb. We find this function of adverbs in nearly every sentence that we read or hear. Examples: The job was done easily . Aunt Julia left early this time. Other Functions of Adverbs Adverbs Describing Adjectives Adverbs are often used to describe adjectives. Examples: This is a very good movie. Sandra worked at an amazingly fast pace. Adverbs Describing Other Adverbs It's not unusual for an adverb to modify another adverb in a sentence. Example: Kiara went through the book fairly quickly. Adverbs Describing Clauses Interestingly, adverbs can sometimes be used to describe an entire clause. Example: Remarkably , China was at the top of the list. Take an Adverb Quiz Now!

CME Info & Disclosures Thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional anticoagulant therapies (heparin and warfarin),\n although efficacious, are associated with limitations in their utility for long-term administration. Consequently, there is\n an ongoing search for new anticoagulant agents. A better understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in coagulation\n has led to the identification of new targets for anticoagulant agents. This article reviews the key events in the cell-based\n model of coagulation, the rationale for current and new targets for anticoagulant agents, and the efficacy and safety of new\n oral anticoagulant agents in late-stage clinical development. Coagulation Simplified Introduction Coagulation is the process through which blood clots are formed at sites of injury to blood vessels. Such clots must form\n rapidly to arrest hemorrhage from the wound, but once formed, the clotting process must be quickly regulated to prevent the\n clot from expanding to the point where it obstructs blood flow. Once bleeding is controlled, the fibrinolytic system degrades\n the blood clot so that blood flow is restored and healing can occur. Coagulation involves a regulated sequence of events in which a series of inactive enzyme precursors, or zymogens, become activated.\n The end result of this process is the timely generation of thrombin, which is also known as factor IIa (FIIa), the enzyme\n that not only converts fibrinogen to fibrin but also amplifies its own generation and serves as a potent platelet agonist.\n The original \"cascade\" or \"waterfall\" models of coagulation proposed 2 independent pathways by which coagulation could be\n initiated in a platelet-free environment. [1,2] Although the concept of distinct extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is useful for understanding in vitro tests of coagulation,\n we now know that these pathways are intricately linked. We also know that platelets and other cellular components of the blood\n are integral parts of the coagulation system. Building on this information, a cell-based model of coagulation has evolved\n in an attempt to better understand the complex reactions that occur on the surface of cells and the integration of processes\n that result in the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus. [3-5] According to the cell-based model of coagulation, the initiating or triggering event occurs on the surface of intact tissue\n factor (TF)-bearing cells or cell fragments, known as microparticles, which are exposed or generated at sites of vascular\n injury. [4,5] Such cells include monocytes, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells among others. As a transmembrane protein, TF on the surface\n of these cells binds circulating FVIIa and the resultant TF:FVIIa complex initiates the generation of a small amount of thrombin\n (the spark). This thrombin then amplifies its own generation, which results in a burst of thrombin (the flame) that converts\n fibrinogen to fibrin, stabilizes the fibrin network, and activates platelets. [4,5] The precisely synchronized sequence of events is counterbalanced by a system of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms,\n which serve to ensure that the hemostatic effect is regulated and does not extend inappropriately. In pathological states,\n these events can escape normal control mechanisms due to either inherited or acquired defects, resulting in thrombosis, which\n is the generation of an occlusive thrombus that obstructs or limits blood flow in an artery or vein. Based on current knowledge of the main triggers and a better understanding of the structure and function of the key coagulation\n enzymes, anticoagulant therapy is moving towards targeted therapy. This article reviews our current understanding of the coagulation\n system, identifies the major enzymes in this pathway, and provides a rationale for the selection of targets for novel anticoagulants.

CME Info & Disclosures Thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional anticoagulant therapies (heparin and warfarin),\n although efficacious, are associated with limitations in their utility for long-term administration. Consequently, there is\n an ongoing search for new anticoagulant agents. A better understanding of the biochemical pathways involved in coagulation\n has led to the identification of new targets for anticoagulant agents. This article reviews the key events in the cell-based\n model of coagulation, the rationale for current and new targets for anticoagulant agents, and the efficacy and safety of new\n oral anticoagulant agents in late-stage clinical development. Coagulation Simplified Introduction Coagulation is the process through which blood clots are formed at sites of injury to blood vessels. Such clots must form\n rapidly to arrest hemorrhage from the wound, but once formed, the clotting process must be quickly regulated to prevent the\n clot from expanding to the point where it obstructs blood flow. Once bleeding is controlled, the fibrinolytic system degrades\n the blood clot so that blood flow is restored and healing can occur. Coagulation involves a regulated sequence of events in which a series of inactive enzyme precursors, or zymogens, become activated.\n The end result of this process is the timely generation of thrombin, which is also known as factor IIa (FIIa), the enzyme\n that not only converts fibrinogen to fibrin but also amplifies its own generation and serves as a potent platelet agonist.\n The original \"cascade\" or \"waterfall\" models of coagulation proposed 2 independent pathways by which coagulation could be\n initiated in a platelet-free environment. [1,2] Although the concept of distinct extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is useful for understanding in vitro tests of coagulation,\n we now know that these pathways are intricately linked. We also know that platelets and other cellular components of the blood\n are integral parts of the coagulation system. Building on this information, a cell-based model of coagulation has evolved\n in an attempt to better understand the complex reactions that occur on the surface of cells and the integration of processes\n that result in the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus. [3-5] According to the cell-based model of coagulation, the initiating or triggering event occurs on the surface of intact tissue\n factor (TF)-bearing cells or cell fragments, known as microparticles, which are exposed or generated at sites of vascular\n injury. [4,5] Such cells include monocytes, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells among others. As a transmembrane protein, TF on the surface\n of these cells binds circulating FVIIa and the resultant TF:FVIIa complex initiates the generation of a small amount of thrombin\n (the spark). This thrombin then amplifies its own generation, which results in a burst of thrombin (the flame) that converts\n fibrinogen to fibrin, stabilizes the fibrin network, and activates platelets. [4,5] The precisely synchronized sequence of events is counterbalanced by a system of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms,\n which serve to ensure that the hemostatic effect is regulated and does not extend inappropriately. In pathological states,\n these events can escape normal control mechanisms due to either inherited or acquired defects, resulting in thrombosis, which\n is the generation of an occlusive thrombus that obstructs or limits blood flow in an artery or vein. Based on current knowledge of the main triggers and a better understanding of the structure and function of the key coagulation\n enzymes, anticoagulant therapy is moving towards targeted therapy. This article reviews our current understanding of the coagulation\n system, identifies the major enzymes in this pathway, and provides a rationale for the selection of targets for novel anticoagulants.

As different as they may appear, all rocks have something in common, they are all made up of minerals . Rocks are formed by a combination of different minerals. There are over 4,000 known minerals on the Earth today. Only one-hundred minerals are considered common. Less than twenty of these will form rocks. A rock is a naturally occurring solid substance made up of one or more minerals, mineraloids, or organic materials. Minerals are chemical compounds or sometimes are a single element. A mineral is naturally occurring and is inorganic. Inorganic means the substance is not formed from living organisms or their remains. Minerals have a crystalline structure and a specific chemical composition. Pictured here are minerals from the Grandview Mine. These samples contain azurite (dark blue), gypsum (colorless, rhombohedral crystals), malachite (green), and smithsonite (yellow). NPS photograph my Michael Quinn. In the public domain. Samples of Minerals Micah Quartz with gold Gympsum Minerals can be identified based on their physical and chemical properties, such as color, hardness, luster, cleavage, and specific gravity. Minerals are important for a wide range of purposes, including building materials, electronics, and the production of metals and other industrial products. Minerals are used in a variety of household and office products that we use everyday. Others are cut, polished and valued for their beauty. We call these special minerals, gems . Diamonds, sapphires, amethyst and rubies are all called gems. The mineral graphite is combined with clay to form the “lead” that is used in our pencils. Halite is a mineral found on every grocery store shelf, as well as in most homes. Commonly known as rock salt, halite is formed from evaporating sea water. Found in sedimentary rocks, this mineral is mined in large caves around the world. Talc is the softest of all the minerals. It has a smooth, somewhat greasy feel and is found in metamorphic rocks. Talc is the main ingredient in many cosmetics, including face powder and baby power. It is also used as a filler for paints. The Rock Cycle Explained – 3 Types of Rock As the rock cycle is explained (below), it’s important to understand the 3 main classifications or types of rocks we will learn about during this adventure: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic . Each group of rocks has unique characteristics that help us identify them. What are Igneous Rocks? Igneous rocks are rocks that are formed from the cooling and of magma or lava. Magma is molten rock that is found beneath the Earth’s surface. Once magma erupts, it is called lava. When magma or lava cools and solidifies, its minerals crystallize and form solid rock. Igneous rocks can be classified into two categories: intrusive or extrusive. Intrusive rocks form beneath the Earth’s surface when magma cools slowly and solidifies, resulting in coarse-grained rocks like granite. On the other hand, extrusive rocks are formed when lava cools quickly on the surface, resulting in fine-grained rocks such as basalt. Igneous rocks are the most abundant rocks on the Earth’s surface. There are two types of igneous rock extrusive and intrusive. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed when volcanoes erupt, spilling lava unto the earth’s surface. This extremely hot melted rock quickly cools and hardens once it reaches the surface. Because it cools quickly, crystals or holes formed within the rock will be extremely small. Examples include obsidian, basalt, and rhyolite. Intrusive igneous rocks form when melted rock, called magma , becomes trapped under the Earth’s surface, forming a magma pool . As the trapped magma cools, large crystals, or holes, form within the rock. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, pumice , and diorite . Some key characteristics of igneous rocks: Dark-colored Heavy Many have holes Usually made of two or mor different grain (tiny rocks) sizes What are Sedimentary Rocks? Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediments like sand, silt, gravel, and other very small pieces build up and then are compressed. Over time, the sediment is compacted, and the layers are cemented together to form a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are found in many different environments, including river beds, ocean floors, and deserts. Sediment comes in different forms. It can be small grains of rock or small pieces of clay. These different types of sediment are what give a sedimentary rock its characteristics and appearance. For example, sandstone is a type of sedimentary rock that is composed mainly of sand-sized grains of minerals or rocks, while shale is a type of sedimentary rock that is composed mainly of clay and silt-sized particles. Sedimentary rocks are important because they often contain fossilized remains of plants and animals. They are also important resources for our everyday lives, as many sedimentary rocks are used as building materials, such as sandstone and limestone, or as a source of energy, such as coal. Characteristics of sedimentary rocks: Smaller rocks are cemented together to make one. May have fossils Light colored Lightweight Small layers Resources to Use with a Rock Study What are Metamorphic Rocks? Metamorphic rocks are formed from the alteration of existing rocks through heat, pressure, and chemical processes. For example, when a sedimentary rock is subjected to intense heat and pressure, it can become a metamorphic rock. There are two kinds of metamorphism – contact and regional. Contact metamorphism is when the rock surrounding molten igneous rock is baked. Regional metamorphism is the change that rock undergoes when rocks are buried deep beneath the Earth’s surface and subjected to high temperatures and pressures, which cause them to change in composition and texture. Regional metamorphism is often associated with mountain-building processes. As the rocks are buried deeper, they are subjected to increasing temperature and pressure, which causes them to undergo metamorphic changes. Examples of rocks that can undergo regional metamorphism include shale, sandstone, and limestone. Shale can be transformed into slate, while sandstone can be transformed into quartzite. Limestone can be transformed into marble. Some key characteristics of metamorphic rocks: Grains are pressed together tightly. Layers Stripes of light and dark colors Lightweight Will make a “cling” sound when hit together instead of a “clunk” The Rock Cycle Explained and Diagram Now that we know about the 3 types of rock, it’s time to explain the rock cycle! Whenever I teach the rock cycle, I always grapple with whether to teach about the types of rock first or present the life cycle first. The rock cycle is a natural process that explains how different types of rocks are formed, changed, and transformed over time. The rock cycle is a never-ending cycle, with rocks constantly changing from one type to another through different geological processes. The rock cycle is explained as a diagram to show best the different conditions that cause rocks to change and how new rocks are formed. Many of these conditions occur beneath the Earth’s surface where we cannot see them, such as melting, increasing pressure, and intense heat. Other conditions occur on the Earth’s surface, such as erosion, deposition, and weathering. So, erosion, deposition, and weathering are 3 of the 7 parts of the rock cycle. All seven are listed below the rock cycle diagram. Looking at the chart below, let’s start with magma. When magma or lava cools and solidifies, igneous rock is formed. Over time, as the igneous rock is exposed to wind, rain, hail, and other weathering, the rock begins to break down into various size pieces. These pieces are called sediment. The sediment can get carried away by water (rain, rivers, streams) and deposited. Layers of sediment build up and get compacted. They get cemented together. (Think of cement sidewalks, parking lots, and roads that you see. Look closely at the cement. What do you see?) As sedimentary rocks is buried deeper into the Earth’s crust, it is exposed to pressure and heat. These two intense forces (pressure and heat), cause the rock to become metamorphic rock. As the metamorphic rock is exposed to more heat for longer periods of time, it begins to melt. When the rock melts it becomes magma. You can also see in the chart that igneous rock can also be exposed to heat and pressure, without becoming sediment and become metamorphic rock. What other relationships do you see between the three different types of rock and the forces of heat and pressure? The arrows in the rock cycle chart show how these forces interact and create the geologic formations we see. Processes in the Rock Cycle Weathering : Wind, water, temperature changes, and chemical reactions break rocks into smaller pieces. Erosion : The process of transporting broken-down rock pieces or sediments to new locations by water, wind, or ice. Deposition : Deposition is when sediment is laid down or deposited on the surface of the Earth or in a creek, pond, lake, river, or ocean. Compaction : When sediment accumulates, the weight of the top layers presses down on the bottom layers. Any air pockets and water in the bottom layers are squeezed out. Compaction is important to the formation of sedimentary rocks. Some of these include sandstone, shale, and limestone. Cementation : The process of binding the sediments together with minerals which act as a glue, forming sedimentary rock. Calcite, silica, and iron oxide are the most common minerals that work like cement (glue) to form sedimentary rocks. Metamorphism : The process of changing existing rocks by subjecting them to high temperatures and high pressure resulting in the formation of metamorphic rocks. Melting : When rocks reach the point where they melt and become molten. We call this molten rock magma when it is under the Earth’s surface. When magma comes out of a volcano, we call it lava. Rock melts when it is exposed to high temperatures and high pressure. Rock Cycle Explained – Make a Metamorphic “Rock Slab” We’ve spent a lot of time explaining the rock cycle and the 3 types of rocks, now, we’re going to demonstrate how metamorphic rock forms from sedimentary rock. We’ll be using a few slices of bread and heavy objects. Print Make a Slab of Metamorphic Rock In this activity we will use a simple model and process to show how a sedimentary rock (the bread) can become a metamorphic rock by undergoing the forces of pressure and heat. Prep Time 15 minutes mins Active Time 1 hour hr Materials 2-4 pieces white bread 2-4 pieces whole wheat bread 1 ruler 1 pencil 1-2 paper plates 2-3 paper towels Several heavy books and some items that weigh between 8 to 10 pounds. We used a 10 pound hand weight Copy of the printable – see request box below 1-2 pieces Optional: You can also use other bread, like rye or pumpernickel and increase the number of total slices used. Instructions Give each person 2 to 4 slices of white bread and 2 to 4 slices of wheat bread. We mixed and matched and used anywhere from 4 to 7 pieces. You may opt to add a third type of bread. (Rye, sourdough, pumpernickel) Measure width, length, and height of each piece of bread. (\"Layer of sediment\") Draw a picture and record measurements in box 1 of the lab sheet. Examine each layer of sedimentary (each slice of bread.) Do you see any small pieces of sediment? Record what you see in box 1 of the lab sheet. Stack the bread on a paper plate or paper towel. Line them up neatly. Lining them up uniformly helps make the effects of the heat and pressure more visible. This represents a sedimentary rock. Cover the “rock sandwich” with another paper towel. Place several heavy books on top of the covered bread. (We used two heavy textbooks.) After 30 minutes remove the books and paper towel. Repeat the measurements and fill out box 2 on the observation sheet. Next place the stack of bread carefully on the paper plate and cook in the microwave for 30 seconds. This will be hot, so use a dish towel or hot pads to remove it from the microwave. Place the dish back in your work area. Record what you see, carefully touch the top of the \"rock slab.\" What does it feel like, record your observations in box 3 on the observation sheet. Cover the bread with a paper towel. Put the books back on top of the bread. Next, place the additional 10 pounds on top. We used a 10-pound hand weight. Wait another 15-20 minutes. Remove the heavy objects and paper towel. Measure again, record the results, and draw a picture in box 4 of the worksheet. Discuss what was observed. Review the questions below and on the worksheet. Compare the before and after.

As different as they may appear, all rocks have something in common, they are all made up of minerals . Rocks are formed by a combination of different minerals. There are over 4,000 known minerals on the Earth today. Only one-hundred minerals are considered common. Less than twenty of these will form rocks. A rock is a naturally occurring solid substance made up of one or more minerals, mineraloids, or organic materials. Minerals are chemical compounds or sometimes are a single element. A mineral is naturally occurring and is inorganic. Inorganic means the substance is not formed from living organisms or their remains. Minerals have a crystalline structure and a specific chemical composition. Pictured here are minerals from the Grandview Mine. These samples contain azurite (dark blue), gypsum (colorless, rhombohedral crystals), malachite (green), and smithsonite (yellow). NPS photograph my Michael Quinn. In the public domain. Samples of Minerals Micah Quartz with gold Gympsum Minerals can be identified based on their physical and chemical properties, such as color, hardness, luster, cleavage, and specific gravity. Minerals are important for a wide range of purposes, including building materials, electronics, and the production of metals and other industrial products. Minerals are used in a variety of household and office products that we use everyday. Others are cut, polished and valued for their beauty. We call these special minerals, gems . Diamonds, sapphires, amethyst and rubies are all called gems. The mineral graphite is combined with clay to form the “lead” that is used in our pencils. Halite is a mineral found on every grocery store shelf, as well as in most homes. Commonly known as rock salt, halite is formed from evaporating sea water. Found in sedimentary rocks, this mineral is mined in large caves around the world. Talc is the softest of all the minerals. It has a smooth, somewhat greasy feel and is found in metamorphic rocks. Talc is the main ingredient in many cosmetics, including face powder and baby power. It is also used as a filler for paints. The Rock Cycle Explained – 3 Types of Rock As the rock cycle is explained (below), it’s important to understand the 3 main classifications or types of rocks we will learn about during this adventure: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic . Each group of rocks has unique characteristics that help us identify them. What are Igneous Rocks? Igneous rocks are rocks that are formed from the cooling and of magma or lava. Magma is molten rock that is found beneath the Earth’s surface. Once magma erupts, it is called lava. When magma or lava cools and solidifies, its minerals crystallize and form solid rock. Igneous rocks can be classified into two categories: intrusive or extrusive. Intrusive rocks form beneath the Earth’s surface when magma cools slowly and solidifies, resulting in coarse-grained rocks like granite. On the other hand, extrusive rocks are formed when lava cools quickly on the surface, resulting in fine-grained rocks such as basalt. Igneous rocks are the most abundant rocks on the Earth’s surface. There are two types of igneous rock extrusive and intrusive. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed when volcanoes erupt, spilling lava unto the earth’s surface. This extremely hot melted rock quickly cools and hardens once it reaches the surface. Because it cools quickly, crystals or holes formed within the rock will be extremely small. Examples include obsidian, basalt, and rhyolite. Intrusive igneous rocks form when melted rock, called magma , becomes trapped under the Earth’s surface, forming a magma pool . As the trapped magma cools, large crystals, or holes, form within the rock. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, pumice , and diorite . Some key characteristics of igneous rocks: Dark-colored Heavy Many have holes Usually made of two or mor different grain (tiny rocks) sizes What are Sedimentary Rocks? Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediments like sand, silt, gravel, and other very small pieces build up and then are compressed. Over time, the sediment is compacted, and the layers are cemented together to form a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rocks are found in many different environments, including river beds, ocean floors, and deserts. Sediment comes in different forms. It can be small grains of rock or small pieces of clay. These different types of sediment are what give a sedimentary rock its characteristics and appearance. For example, sandstone is a type of sedimentary rock that is composed mainly of sand-sized grains of minerals or rocks, while shale is a type of sedimentary rock that is composed mainly of clay and silt-sized particles. Sedimentary rocks are important because they often contain fossilized remains of plants and animals. They are also important resources for our everyday lives, as many sedimentary rocks are used as building materials, such as sandstone and limestone, or as a source of energy, such as coal. Characteristics of sedimentary rocks: Smaller rocks are cemented together to make one. May have fossils Light colored Lightweight Small layers Resources to Use with a Rock Study What are Metamorphic Rocks? Metamorphic rocks are formed from the alteration of existing rocks through heat, pressure, and chemical processes.

When you first start using High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ), it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the complex components and terminology. One term you’ll hear frequently is “stationary phase.” But what does it actually mean, and why should you care about it? Well, let’s dive into it and break things down in a way that’s easy to understand—almost like you and I are sitting down over a cup of coffee, chatting about it. What Is the Stationary Phase in HPLC? At its core, the stationary phase in HPLC refers to the material that stays fixed in place inside the chromatographic column. It’s what your sample will interact with during the separation process. But why is this important? Well, the stationary phase plays a huge role in determining how different compounds in your sample will separate and elute (come out of the column) over time. So, without a solid understanding of the stationary phase, your HPLC results could be all over the place. Why Does the Stationary Phase Matter? analyst is working in laboratory with connecting hplc column to the hplc system. You might be wondering, “Why is this stationary phase such a big deal?” Well, it’s simple: the stationary phase dictates how well your sample components separate from each other. Think of it like this: Imagine you’re at a crowded party, and you’re trying to find your friends. The stationary phase is like the venue’s layout—whether it’s a narrow hallway or a big open room—it directly affects how fast and in what order you and your friends can get through the crowd. In the same way, the stationary phase affects the speed and order at which compounds travel through the column. Types of Stationary Phases: What Are My Options? Now, you’re probably thinking, “Okay, so there are different stationary phases. What are they?” The two main types you’ll encounter are reversed-phase and normal-phase stationary phases. But what exactly does this mean? Reversed-Phase Stationary Phase : This is the most commonly used type in modern HPLC , and it’s great for separating compounds that are hydrophobic (i.e., water-repelling). It’s typically made from materials like silica, but with non-polar groups bonded to it. If your sample is water-soluble, reversed-phase chromatography can be your best friend. What do you think? Does this sound like a setup that would work for your lab? Normal-Phase Stationary Phase : This is the opposite. It’s often used when dealing with more polar compounds, and the stationary phase here is usually just plain silica. In this case, the mobile phase (the liquid or solvent pushing the compounds through) is typically non-polar. There’s also a variety of other stationary phases out there, like ion-exchange and size-exclusion phases, but I won’t dive too deep into those here—unless you’d like me to! How the Stationary Phase Works in HPLC Let’s go a bit deeper into how the stationary phase actually works within the HPLC system. The separation of compounds depends on how they interact with the stationary phase. This interaction is often governed by several forces, including: Adsorption : This is where compounds stick to the surface of the stationary phase. Some compounds have a stronger “affinity” for the stationary phase than others, so they’ll stick around longer. That means they’ll elute later. Partitioning : This happens when compounds dissolve into the stationary phase to some extent and then move in and out. How much a compound dissolves depends on its polarity and the nature of the stationary phase. Ion-exchange : If your stationary phase is made to interact with charged particles (ions), you’ll see an exchange between the ions in your sample and those attached to the stationary phase. How Do I Choose the Right Stationary Phase? Okay, but how do you choose the right stationary phase for your HPLC analysis? This really depends on a few factors, including: The Nature of Your Sample : Is your sample polar or non-polar? Does it contain ionic compounds? The composition of your sample is key to selecting the best stationary phase. The Desired Separation : Are you trying to separate small, volatile compounds or larger, more complex molecules? Different stationary phases offer varying levels of selectivity and efficiency, so you’ll want to match the phase to the task at hand. The Mobile Phase : The stationary phase interacts with the mobile phase, and the two work together to separate the components of your sample. Your choice of stationary phase might influence the kind of solvents you use in the mobile phase. The Role of Surface Area in Stationary Phases It’s not just about the material you use for the stationary phase; surface area matters, too. A larger surface area means more interaction points for your sample, which can result in better separation. Silica, for example, has a high surface area and is often used in reversed-phase HPLC columns. So, how much surface area do you think is right for your work? More isn’t always better—it really depends on what you’re analyzing. Optimizing Your HPLC Process: A Few Tips chemist or scientist in rubber gloves changing a column on high performance liquid chromatography As you dive into using the stationary phase in your HPLC work, here are a few tips that can help you optimize your results: Column Selection : Don’t just settle for the first column you find. Choose the one that suits your sample and analysis goals. The stationary phase material, pore size, and particle size all impact the outcome. Temperature Control : Temperature can influence how compounds interact with the stationary phase. Experimenting with different temperatures might help improve separation in some cases. Mobile Phase Compatibility : The stationary phase needs to work well with the solvents (mobile phase) you plan to use. Keep in mind that some solvents can degrade or damage certain stationary phases over time. Conclusion: Understanding Stationary Phases for Better Results So, what do you think? Does the stationary phase sound a bit clearer now? In HPLC, this component isn’t just a technical detail—it’s one of the most critical factors in achieving the separation and analysis results you need. By selecting the right stationary phase, you can optimize your chromatographic process, save time, and get more accurate data. If you’re looking to improve your HPLC setup, this is definitely an area worth diving deeper into. When choosing your stationary phase, remember that it’s all about matching it to your sample, your goals, and the conditions of your lab. So, what are you waiting for?

When you first start using High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ), it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the complex components and terminology. One term you’ll hear frequently is “stationary phase.” But what does it actually mean, and why should you care about it? Well, let’s dive into it and break things down in a way that’s easy to understand—almost like you and I are sitting down over a cup of coffee, chatting about it. What Is the Stationary Phase in HPLC? At its core, the stationary phase in HPLC refers to the material that stays fixed in place inside the chromatographic column. It’s what your sample will interact with during the separation process. But why is this important? Well, the stationary phase plays a huge role in determining how different compounds in your sample will separate and elute (come out of the column) over time. So, without a solid understanding of the stationary phase, your HPLC results could be all over the place. Why Does the Stationary Phase Matter? analyst is working in laboratory with connecting hplc column to the hplc system. You might be wondering, “Why is this stationary phase such a big deal?” Well, it’s simple: the stationary phase dictates how well your sample components separate from each other. Think of it like this: Imagine you’re at a crowded party, and you’re trying to find your friends. The stationary phase is like the venue’s layout—whether it’s a narrow hallway or a big open room—it directly affects how fast and in what order you and your friends can get through the crowd. In the same way, the stationary phase affects the speed and order at which compounds travel through the column. Types of Stationary Phases: What Are My Options? Now, you’re probably thinking, “Okay, so there are different stationary phases. What are they?” The two main types you’ll encounter are reversed-phase and normal-phase stationary phases. But what exactly does this mean? Reversed-Phase Stationary Phase : This is the most commonly used type in modern HPLC , and it’s great for separating compounds that are hydrophobic (i.e., water-repelling). It’s typically made from materials like silica, but with non-polar groups bonded to it. If your sample is water-soluble, reversed-phase chromatography can be your best friend. What do you think? Does this sound like a setup that would work for your lab? Normal-Phase Stationary Phase : This is the opposite. It’s often used when dealing with more polar compounds, and the stationary phase here is usually just plain silica. In this case, the mobile phase (the liquid or solvent pushing the compounds through) is typically non-polar. There’s also a variety of other stationary phases out there, like ion-exchange and size-exclusion phases, but I won’t dive too deep into those here—unless you’d like me to! How the Stationary Phase Works in HPLC Let’s go a bit deeper into how the stationary phase actually works within the HPLC system. The separation of compounds depends on how they interact with the stationary phase. This interaction is often governed by several forces, including: Adsorption : This is where compounds stick to the surface of the stationary phase. Some compounds have a stronger “affinity” for the stationary phase than others, so they’ll stick around longer. That means they’ll elute later. Partitioning : This happens when compounds dissolve into the stationary phase to some extent and then move in and out. How much a compound dissolves depends on its polarity and the nature of the stationary phase. Ion-exchange : If your stationary phase is made to interact with charged particles (ions), you’ll see an exchange between the ions in your sample and those attached to the stationary phase. How Do I Choose the Right Stationary Phase? Okay, but how do you choose the right stationary phase for your HPLC analysis? This really depends on a few factors, including: The Nature of Your Sample : Is your sample polar or non-polar? Does it contain ionic compounds? The composition of your sample is key to selecting the best stationary phase. The Desired Separation : Are you trying to separate small, volatile compounds or larger, more complex molecules? Different stationary phases offer varying levels of selectivity and efficiency, so you’ll want to match the phase to the task at hand. The Mobile Phase : The stationary phase interacts with the mobile phase, and the two work together to separate the components of your sample. Your choice of stationary phase might influence the kind of solvents you use in the mobile phase. The Role of Surface Area in Stationary Phases It’s not just about the material you use for the stationary phase; surface area matters, too. A larger surface area means more interaction points for your sample, which can result in better separation. Silica, for example, has a high surface area and is often used in reversed-phase HPLC columns. So, how much surface area do you think is right for your work? More isn’t always better—it really depends on what you’re analyzing. Optimizing Your HPLC Process: A Few Tips chemist or scientist in rubber gloves changing a column on high performance liquid chromatography As you dive into using the stationary phase in your HPLC work, here are a few tips that can help you optimize your results: Column Selection : Don’t just settle for the first column you find. Choose the one that suits your sample and analysis goals. The stationary phase material, pore size, and particle size all impact the outcome. Temperature Control : Temperature can influence how compounds interact with the stationary phase. Experimenting with different temperatures might help improve separation in some cases. Mobile Phase Compatibility : The stationary phase needs to work well with the solvents (mobile phase) you plan to use. Keep in mind that some solvents can degrade or damage certain stationary phases over time. Conclusion: Understanding Stationary Phases for Better Results So, what do you think? Does the stationary phase sound a bit clearer now? In HPLC, this component isn’t just a technical detail—it’s one of the most critical factors in achieving the separation and analysis results you need. By selecting the right stationary phase, you can optimize your chromatographic process, save time, and get more accurate data. If you’re looking to improve your HPLC setup, this is definitely an area worth diving deeper into. When choosing your stationary phase, remember that it’s all about matching it to your sample, your goals, and the conditions of your lab. So, what are you waiting for?

Start for Free Iliya Valchanov 26 Jul 2024 5 min read The sum of squares is a statistical measure of variability. It indicates the dispersion of data points around the mean and how much the dependent variable deviates from the predicted values in regression analysis. We decompose variability into the sum of squares total (SST), the sum of squares regression (SSR), and the sum of squares error (SSE). The decomposition of variability helps us understand the sources of variation in our data, assess a model’s goodness of fit, and understand the relationship between variables. We define SST, SSR, and SSE below and explain what aspects of variability each measure. But first, ensure you’re not mistaking regression for correlation . Table of Contents SST, SSR, SSE: Definition and Formulas The Confusion between the Different Abbreviations What Is the Relationship Between SSR, SSE, and SST? Next Steps SST, SSR, SSE: Definition and Formulas This article addresses SST, SSR, and SSE in the context of the ANOVA framework , but the sums of squares are frequently used in various statistical analyses. What Is SST in Statistics? The sum of squares total ( SST ) or the total sum of squares (TSS) is the sum of squared differences between the observed dependent variables and the overall mean . Think of it as the dispersion of the observed variables around the mean —similar to the variance in descriptive statistics. But SST measures the total variability of a dataset, commonly used in regression analysis and ANOVA. Mathematically, the difference between variance and SST is that we adjust for the degree of freedom by dividing by n–1 in the variance formula. S S T = n ∑ i = 1 ( y i − ¯ y ) 2 S S T = ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − y ¯ ) 2 Where: y i y i – observed dependent variable ¯ y y ¯ – mean of the dependent variable What Is SSR in Statistics? The sum of squares due to regression ( SSR) or explained sum of squares (ESS) is the sum of the differences between the predicted value and the mean of the dependent variable . In other words, it describes how well our line fits the data. The SSR formula is the following: S S R = n ∑ i = 1 ( ^ y i − ¯ y ) 2 S S R = ∑ i = 1 n ( y ^ i − y ¯ ) 2 Where: ^ y i y ^ i – the predicted value of the dependent variable ¯ y y ¯ – mean of the dependent variable If SSR equals SST , our regression model perfectly captures all the observed variability, but that’s rarely the case. Alternatively, you can use a Sum of Squares Calculator to simplify the process. What Is SSE in Statistics? The sum of squares error ( SSE) or residual sum of squares (RSS, where residual means remaining or unexplained ) is the difference between the observed and predicted values. The SSE calculation uses the following formula: S S E = n ∑ i = 1 ε 2 i S S E = ∑ i = 1 n ε i 2 Where ε i ε i is the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable and the predicted value: ε i = y i − ^ y i ε i = y i − y ^ i Regression analysis aims to minimize the SSE —the smaller the error, the better the regression’s estimation power. The Confusion between the Abbreviations As mentioned, the sum of squares error (SSE) is also known as the residual sum of squares (RSS), but some individuals denote it as SSR , which is also the abbreviation for the sum of squares due to regression. Although there’s no universal standard for abbreviations of these terms, you can readily discern the distinctions by carefully observing and comprehending them. The conflict regards the abbreviations, not the concepts or their application. So, remember the definitions and the possible notations ( SST , SSR , SSE or TSS , ESS , RSS) and how they relate. What Is the Relationship between SSR, SSE, and SST ? Mathematically, SST = SSR + SSE . The rationale is the following: The total variability of the dataset is equal to the variability explained by the regression line plus the unexplained variability, known as error. Given a constant total variability, a lower error means a better regression model. Conversely, a higher error means a less robust regression . And that’s valid regardless of the notation you use. Next Steps Why do we need SST, SSR, and SSE? We can use them to calculate the R-squared , conduct F-tests in regression analysis, and combine them with other goodness-of-fit measures to evaluate regression models. Our linear regression calculator automatically generates the SSE, SST, SSR, and other relevant statistical measures.

Intermediate in silica content, it is usually gray in color and may be fine-grained or porphyritic. Andesite is the volcanic equivalent of diorite . It consists of the plagioclase feldspar minerals andesine and oligoclase, together with one or more dark, ferromagnesian minerals such as pyroxene and biotite . Amygdaloidal andesite occurs when the voids left by gas bubbles in the solidifying magma are later filled in, often with zeolite minerals. Andesite erupts from volcanoes and is commonly found interbedded with volcanic ash and tuff . Ancient andesites are used to map ancient subduction zones because andesitic volcanoes form on continental or ocean crust above these zones.

However, the andezit has higher SiO2 content (>\n52 wt. %) compared to that in basalt with less than 52 wt. % SiO2. Modal composition projected within the QAPF discrimination diagram for volcanic rock (Streckeisen, 1978) Chemical Composition of Andesite Andesite is an intermediate sub-alkalic rock with SiO2 contents ranging between 57 and 63 wt. %, and Na2O + K2O contents around 5 wt. %. Intermediate rocks are also characterized by an increased CaO content compared to that in acidic rocks. Similar CaO contents (6 – 7 wt. %) are also typical for diorite – the plutonic equivalent of andesite. The andesite from Šiatorska Bukovinka is metaluminous, medium-potassic rock with A/CNK = 0.95 and A/NK = 2.38. The Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) ratio was recalculated after the conversion of all Fe2O3 to FeO. Trace element contents in andesites with garnets are similar to those without garnets. They only show a moderate enrichment in large lithophile elements (LILE – K, Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba), negative Nb anomaly and positive Pb anomaly pronounced in normalized records of trace elements. Such trends are typical for the magmas originating in subduction zones. Contents of rare earth elements La-Eu in garnet-bearing andesites are similar to those in garnet-free andesites. However, the garnet-bearing andesites are little depleted in heavy rare earth elements compared to the garnet-free andesites what probably reflects the garnet fractionation (Harangi et al., 2001). Formation of Andesite Andesite generally occurs in convergent plate cages.\nContains some processes in its formation. Fractional crystallization of a mafic parent\nmagma. Partial melting of crustal material. Magma mixing between the magmas in a magma reservoir For the formation of andesite, a basaltic magma must then\ncrystallize certain minerals removed from the melt. The first minerals that\ncrystallize and emerge from a basaltic base material are olivine and\namphiboles. These mafic minerals are separated from the magma and form mafic\ncumulates. Once these mafic minerals have been removed, the melt has no\nresidual basaltic composition. The silica content of the melt is now enriched\nwith respect to the starting composition. As this process continues, the melt\ngradually develops and eventually becomes andesitic. In the mantle wedge section, the molten basalt moves upwards\nuntil it reaches the base of the dominant shell. Once there, the basaltic melt\ncan underline in its shell, there may be a layer of molten material, or it may\ngo into the top plate in the form of dams. Together, the basalt melts the\nmaterial of the pelitic upper crust. It is the result of melting in the crust\nof island arches and andesitic magmas. In the continental springs such as the Andes, magma is pooled in the shallow shell and forms magma chambers. As cristalization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool down in time. In order to remain active, magma chambers should have continued to reload the hot basaltic solution into the system. When this basaltic material is mixed with advanced riolitic magma, the composition is returned to the intermediate phase andesite. Distribution Andesite is a type of volcanic rock that is commonly found in association with volcanic activity, particularly in subduction zone environments. Here are some of the locations where andesite can be found: The Andes Mountains (South America): Andesite is named after the Andes Mountains, which run along the western edge of South America. This region is a prime example of a volcanic arc formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Andesitic volcanoes are abundant in the Andes, and they erupt andesitic lava flows and volcanic ash. Cascade Range (North America): The Cascade Range in the western United States, including states like Washington, Oregon, and northern California, is another well-known location for andesitic volcanism. These volcanoes are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, and they erupt andesitic and dacitic lavas. Java and Indonesia: Indonesia, particularly the island of Java, has numerous andesitic volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. The explosive eruption of these volcanoes can pose significant hazards to nearby populations. Japan: Japan, like Indonesia, is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and has several andesitic volcanoes. Mount Fuji, for example, is a well-known andesitic volcano in Japan. Central America: Countries in Central America, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, have andesitic volcanoes along their volcanic arcs. The subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate creates the conditions for andesitic magma formation and eruptions in this region. New Zealand: Both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand have andesitic volcanoes. The Taupo Volcanic Zone on the North Island is particularly active and features numerous andesitic eruptions. The Philippines: The Philippines, located in the western Pacific Ocean, has several andesitic volcanoes due to its location within the Ring of Fire . Mount Mayon, in the Bicol Region of the Philippines, is a famous andesitic volcano. These are just a few examples of regions where andesite is commonly found. Andesitic volcanoes are associated with convergent plate boundaries, where one tectonic plate is subducting beneath another, leading to the generation of andesitic magma through partial melting of the subducting oceanic crust and overlying mantle. Characteristics and Properties of Andesite Rock Andesite, together with pyroxene, consists of plagioclase feldspar . In addition, it may contain hornblende. The minerals that this rock can contain are apatite , garbet, ilmenite, biotite, magnetite , zircon . It may also contain trace\namounts of alkali feldspar. Silica content is moderate. In other words, this\nmineral is neither rich nor deficient. The silica content is 50-65%. The density of such rocks is 2.11 – 2.36 g /\ncm3. It has a porphyritic structure. The term\n‘porphyric’ refers to the incorporation of large crystals into a fine-grained\nrock. The specific gravity of this rock is 2,5 – 2,8. It usually occurs in shades of gray. However, it\nis lighter in color than basalt. It is said that thicker or dome-shaped\nstructures are formed. The hardness of andesite rocks on the Moh scale is 7. Andesite Application and Uses Areas Andesite, as an igneous rock, has several applications and uses in various industries and areas. Its properties, including hardness, durability, and ability to hold a polish, make it valuable for several purposes. Here are some of the primary application areas and uses of andesite: Construction Materials: Andesite is used as a construction material for both interior and exterior applications due to its durability and resistance to weathering . It is often used as dimension stone for building facades, walls, and flooring. Pavement and Road Construction: Crushed andesite is used as an aggregate in the construction of roads, highways, and pavements. Its hardness and wear resistance make it an excellent choice for road base and surface material. Monuments and Sculptures: Because of its ability to hold a polish and its attractive appearance, andesite is sometimes used for monuments, statues, and sculptures. It can be carved into intricate designs and maintains its appearance over time. Countertops and Tiles: Andesite is utilized in the production of countertops, tiles, and other decorative surfaces for kitchens and bathrooms. Its hardness and resistance to staining and scratching make it a popular choice. Cemetery Markers: Due to its durability and resistance to weathering, andesite is used for cemetery markers, headstones, and memorial plaques. Gravestones and Grave Markers: The ability of andesite to hold inscriptions and engravings makes it suitable for gravestones and grave markers. Water Features: Andesite is sometimes used in the construction of fountains, water features, and decorative garden elements due to its aesthetics and resistance to water erosion . Decorative Landscaping: In landscaping, andesite can be used for decorative purposes such as garden pathways, retaining walls, and rock gardens. Fireplace Surrounds: Andesite can be used for fireplace surrounds and mantels due to its heat resistance and appearance. Aquariums and Terrariums: Its ability to withstand moisture and its attractive appearance make andesite a suitable choice for the construction of aquariums and terrariums. Scientific Research: Andesite is used in scientific research and education as a representative rock for studying the properties and behavior of volcanic rocks. Jewelry: While not as commonly used as other stones like granite or marble , andesite can be used in jewelry, typically as beads or cabochons. It’s important to note that the specific uses of andesite may vary depending on its quality, appearance, and availability in a particular region. Additionally, the suitability of andesite for a particular application may be influenced by factors such as local geological conditions and the intended purpose of the material.

Similar CaO contents (6 – 7 wt. %) are also typical for diorite – the plutonic equivalent of andesite. The andesite from Šiatorska Bukovinka is metaluminous, medium-potassic rock with A/CNK = 0.95 and A/NK = 2.38. The Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) ratio was recalculated after the conversion of all Fe2O3 to FeO. Trace element contents in andesites with garnets are similar to those without garnets. They only show a moderate enrichment in large lithophile elements (LILE – K, Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba), negative Nb anomaly and positive Pb anomaly pronounced in normalized records of trace elements. Such trends are typical for the magmas originating in subduction zones. Contents of rare earth elements La-Eu in garnet-bearing andesites are similar to those in garnet-free andesites. However, the garnet-bearing andesites are little depleted in heavy rare earth elements compared to the garnet-free andesites what probably reflects the garnet fractionation (Harangi et al., 2001). Formation of Andesite Andesite generally occurs in convergent plate cages.\nContains some processes in its formation. Fractional crystallization of a mafic parent\nmagma. Partial melting of crustal material. Magma mixing between the magmas in a magma reservoir For the formation of andesite, a basaltic magma must then\ncrystallize certain minerals removed from the melt. The first minerals that\ncrystallize and emerge from a basaltic base material are olivine and\namphiboles. These mafic minerals are separated from the magma and form mafic\ncumulates. Once these mafic minerals have been removed, the melt has no\nresidual basaltic composition. The silica content of the melt is now enriched\nwith respect to the starting composition. As this process continues, the melt\ngradually develops and eventually becomes andesitic. In the mantle wedge section, the molten basalt moves upwards\nuntil it reaches the base of the dominant shell. Once there, the basaltic melt\ncan underline in its shell, there may be a layer of molten material, or it may\ngo into the top plate in the form of dams. Together, the basalt melts the\nmaterial of the pelitic upper crust. It is the result of melting in the crust\nof island arches and andesitic magmas. In the continental springs such as the Andes, magma is pooled in the shallow shell and forms magma chambers. As cristalization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool down in time. In order to remain active, magma chambers should have continued to reload the hot basaltic solution into the system. When this basaltic material is mixed with advanced riolitic magma, the composition is returned to the intermediate phase andesite. Distribution Andesite is a type of volcanic rock that is commonly found in association with volcanic activity, particularly in subduction zone environments. Here are some of the locations where andesite can be found: The Andes Mountains (South America): Andesite is named after the Andes Mountains, which run along the western edge of South America. This region is a prime example of a volcanic arc formed by the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. Andesitic volcanoes are abundant in the Andes, and they erupt andesitic lava flows and volcanic ash. Cascade Range (North America): The Cascade Range in the western United States, including states like Washington, Oregon, and northern California, is another well-known location for andesitic volcanism. These volcanoes are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, and they erupt andesitic and dacitic lavas. Java and Indonesia: Indonesia, particularly the island of Java, has numerous andesitic volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. The explosive eruption of these volcanoes can pose significant hazards to nearby populations. Japan: Japan, like Indonesia, is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and has several andesitic volcanoes. Mount Fuji, for example, is a well-known andesitic volcano in Japan. Central America: Countries in Central America, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, have andesitic volcanoes along their volcanic arcs. The subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate creates the conditions for andesitic magma formation and eruptions in this region. New Zealand: Both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand have andesitic volcanoes. The Taupo Volcanic Zone on the North Island is particularly active and features numerous andesitic eruptions. The Philippines: The Philippines, located in the western Pacific Ocean, has several andesitic volcanoes due to its location within the Ring of Fire . Mount Mayon, in the Bicol Region of the Philippines, is a famous andesitic volcano. These are just a few examples of regions where andesite is commonly found. Andesitic volcanoes are associated with convergent plate boundaries, where one tectonic plate is subducting beneath another, leading to the generation of andesitic magma through partial melting of the subducting oceanic crust and overlying mantle. Characteristics and Properties of Andesite Rock Andesite, together with pyroxene, consists of plagioclase feldspar . In addition, it may contain hornblende. The minerals that this rock can contain are apatite , garbet, ilmenite, biotite, magnetite , zircon . It may also contain trace\namounts of alkali feldspar. Silica content is moderate. In other words, this\nmineral is neither rich nor deficient. The silica content is 50-65%. The density of such rocks is 2.11 – 2.36 g /\ncm3. It has a porphyritic structure. The term\n‘porphyric’ refers to the incorporation of large crystals into a fine-grained\nrock. The specific gravity of this rock is 2,5 – 2,8. It usually occurs in shades of gray. However, it\nis lighter in color than basalt. It is said that thicker or dome-shaped\nstructures are formed. The hardness of andesite rocks on the Moh scale is 7. Andesite Application and Uses Areas Andesite, as an igneous rock, has several applications and uses in various industries and areas. Its properties, including hardness, durability, and ability to hold a polish, make it valuable for several purposes. Here are some of the primary application areas and uses of andesite: Construction Materials: Andesite is used as a construction material for both interior and exterior applications due to its durability and resistance to weathering . It is often used as dimension stone for building facades, walls, and flooring. Pavement and Road Construction: Crushed andesite is used as an aggregate in the construction of roads, highways, and pavements. Its hardness and wear resistance make it an excellent choice for road base and surface material. Monuments and Sculptures: Because of its ability to hold a polish and its attractive appearance, andesite is sometimes used for monuments, statues, and sculptures. It can be carved into intricate designs and maintains its appearance over time. Countertops and Tiles: Andesite is utilized in the production of countertops, tiles, and other decorative surfaces for kitchens and bathrooms. Its hardness and resistance to staining and scratching make it a popular choice. Cemetery Markers: Due to its durability and resistance to weathering, andesite is used for cemetery markers, headstones, and memorial plaques. Gravestones and Grave Markers: The ability of andesite to hold inscriptions and engravings makes it suitable for gravestones and grave markers. Water Features: Andesite is sometimes used in the construction of fountains, water features, and decorative garden elements due to its aesthetics and resistance to water erosion . Decorative Landscaping: In landscaping, andesite can be used for decorative purposes such as garden pathways, retaining walls, and rock gardens. Fireplace Surrounds: Andesite can be used for fireplace surrounds and mantels due to its heat resistance and appearance. Aquariums and Terrariums: Its ability to withstand moisture and its attractive appearance make andesite a suitable choice for the construction of aquariums and terrariums. Scientific Research: Andesite is used in scientific research and education as a representative rock for studying the properties and behavior of volcanic rocks. Jewelry: While not as commonly used as other stones like granite or marble , andesite can be used in jewelry, typically as beads or cabochons. It’s important to note that the specific uses of andesite may vary depending on its quality, appearance, and availability in a particular region. Additionally, the suitability of andesite for a particular application may be influenced by factors such as local geological conditions and the intended purpose of the material.

    "html": "Lesson 19: Net Force Lesson 19: Net Force Up to this point we have been focusing on situations that involve only one force acting on an object. In the real world it is rare to actually find situations like this. Usually there will be at least a couple of forces acting on an object. What we need to do is figure out how all these individual forces act on the object overall. This is what we do when we look at net force . When someone talks about his gross pay and net pay, what do they mean? Gross pay is how much you are paid before any deductions. Net pay is how much you actually get on your paycheck after all the deductions. It’s the same sort of thing when we examine net force . After you have added and subtracted all the forces you are left with the net force acting on the object. There are several common forces acting on objects that you need to memorize: F g = force due to gravity F a = applied force F N = normal force F NET = net force F f = force due to friction To keep track of how all these forces are affecting a single object, it is a good idea to draw a free body diagram . A free body diagram is just a simple sketch of the object showing all the forces that are acting on it. Draw a quick sketch of the object. Draw an arrow showing every force acting on the object. To calculate the net force, add any vectors acting on the same axis (x and y), making sure to pay attention to the directions. Quite often we are able to ignore many of the forces that cancel each other out. We focus on the forces that are actually involved in how the object will move. Most of the time the two forces we can focus on are F a and F f . When we calculate the net force acting on the object in these situations, we use the formula… F NET = F a + F f Notice that we don’t say we are subtracting the two forces. Instead, it’s up to you to remember that if one of the forces is pointing in one direction (like to the right), and the other force is pointing in the other direction (like to the left), you will need to make one positive and the other negative. Example 1 : I want to push my tarantula’s 8.7kg cage across the table. I push with 29N of force, and there is a force due to friction of 8N between the table and the cage. Determine how much the cage will accelerate. First, draw a free body diagram. Since nothing is happening along the y-axis, we can ignore the F g and F N forces. F NET = F a + F f = 29N + -8N F NET = 21N I had to make the friction a negative force because it is pointing in the direction opposite to the applied force. When you want to calculate the acceleration of an object, always use the net force acting on it. F NET = ma a = F NET / m = (21N) / (8.7kg) a = 2.4 m/s 2 The Elevator Question The concept of net force becomes a bit more complicated when you examine a complex system like an elevator going up and down. It might sound strange to call an elevator complex, but it really does make a challenging problem. How do you think you would solve a question that asks you about your weight as an elevator accelerates up or down? When the elevator is accelerating up, what would happen to your weight? Have you ever noticed that when an elevator first starts to move up, you feel yourself pushed down a little? This is because you can feel the elevator’s acceleration… it basically makes you feel a bit heavier for a moment. A scale would show this as an increase in your weight (temporarily). What would happen to your apparent weight if the elevator started to accelerate down? You would feel the elevator drop out underneath you. If it really dropped out underneath you, it would feel just like being on the “Space Shot ” at Galaxyland as it is falling … you’d feel weightless! A scale would show your weight decreasing. Let’s look at how we would actually figure out some numbers for this type of question by looking at an example. Keep one thing in the back of your mind. A regular scale is made to measure things in kilograms, and it is built for Earth’s regular gravity of 9.81m/s 2 . You’ll see why this is important later. Example 2 : You are standing on a scale in an elevator. You have a mass of 75kg. Determine what a scale would show as your “apparent” mass (in kilograms) if… a) the elevator starts to accelerate upwards at 3.0m/s 2 . We need to think of the net force as the force pushing down on the scale causing it to give a reading. The elevator pushing up on me will make me push down on the floor (Newton’s 3rd Law). We will show this by making the acceleration (3.0m/s 2 ) a negative value. The formula for this would look like this… F NET = F g + F a We will treat the force due to gravity (F g ) as just the regular force of my body pushing down on the elevator's floor. The applied force (F a ) is how much the acceleration of the elevator is increasing or decreasing my force on the elevator's floor. F NET = F g + F a = mg + ma <- since mass is common, I’ll factor it out = m ( g + a ) = 75kg ( -9.81m/s 2 + -3.0m/s 2 ) <- both are negative = 75kg (-12.81m/s 2 ) F NET = -9.6e2 N Oy! When was the last time you saw a scale give a reading in Newtons? I can change this into a reading in kilograms by remembering that the scale we're using has no idea what is going on... it still thinks it's sitting in someone's bathroom where gravity is a nice constant 9.81m/s 2 . F NET = mg m = F NET / g = (-9.6e2 N) / (-9.81m/s 2 ) m = 98 kg So a regular scale thinks you weigh 98 kg! b) the elevator starts to accelerate downwards at 4.0m/s 2 . We’ll handle this part of the question the same way. The only difference is that because the elevator is dropping out from under me, I will push less against the floor. The acceleration of the elevator will be positive. F NET = F g + F a = mg + ma = m ( g + a ) = 75kg ( -9.81m/s 2 + 4.0m/s 2 ) <- both are negative = 75kg (-5.81m/s 2 ) F NET = -4.4e2 N The scale will read... F NET = mg m = F NET / g = (-4.4e2 N) / (-9.81m/s 2 ) m = 44 kg So a regular scale thinks you weigh 44 kg!",

Instead, it’s up to you to remember that if one of the forces is pointing in one direction (like to the right), and the other force is pointing in the other direction (like to the left), you will need to make one positive and the other negative. Example 1 : I want to push my tarantula’s 8.7kg cage across the table. I push with 29N of force, and there is a force due to friction of 8N between the table and the cage. Determine how much the cage will accelerate. First, draw a free body diagram. Since nothing is happening along the y-axis, we can ignore the F g and F N forces. F NET = F a + F f = 29N + -8N F NET = 21N I had to make the friction a negative force because it is pointing in the direction opposite to the applied force. When you want to calculate the acceleration of an object, always use the net force acting on it. F NET = ma a = F NET / m = (21N) / (8.7kg) a = 2.4 m/s 2 The Elevator Question The concept of net force becomes a bit more complicated when you examine a complex system like an elevator going up and down. It might sound strange to call an elevator complex, but it really does make a challenging problem. How do you think you would solve a question that asks you about your weight as an elevator accelerates up or down? When the elevator is accelerating up, what would happen to your weight? Have you ever noticed that when an elevator first starts to move up, you feel yourself pushed down a little? This is because you can feel the elevator’s acceleration… it basically makes you feel a bit heavier for a moment. A scale would show this as an increase in your weight (temporarily). What would happen to your apparent weight if the elevator started to accelerate down? You would feel the elevator drop out underneath you. If it really dropped out underneath you, it would feel just like being on the “Space Shot ” at Galaxyland as it is falling … you’d feel weightless! A scale would show your weight decreasing. Let’s look at how we would actually figure out some numbers for this type of question by looking at an example. Keep one thing in the back of your mind. A regular scale is made to measure things in kilograms, and it is built for Earth’s regular gravity of 9.81m/s 2 . You’ll see why this is important later. Example 2 : You are standing on a scale in an elevator. You have a mass of 75kg. Determine what a scale would show as your “apparent” mass (in kilograms) if… a) the elevator starts to accelerate upwards at 3.0m/s 2 . We need to think of the net force as the force pushing down on the scale causing it to give a reading. The elevator pushing up on me will make me push down on the floor (Newton’s 3rd Law). We will show this by making the acceleration (3.0m/s 2 ) a negative value. The formula for this would look like this… F NET = F g + F a We will treat the force due to gravity (F g ) as just the regular force of my body pushing down on the elevator's floor. The applied force (F a ) is how much the acceleration of the elevator is increasing or decreasing my force on the elevator's floor. F NET = F g + F a = mg + ma <- since mass is common, I’ll factor it out = m ( g + a ) = 75kg ( -9.81m/s 2 + -3.0m/s 2 ) <- both are negative = 75kg (-12.81m/s 2 ) F NET = -9.6e2 N Oy! When was the last time you saw a scale give a reading in Newtons? I can change this into a reading in kilograms by remembering that the scale we're using has no idea what is going on... it still thinks it's sitting in someone's bathroom where gravity is a nice constant 9.81m/s 2 . F NET = mg m = F NET / g = (-9.6e2 N) / (-9.81m/s 2 ) m = 98 kg So a regular scale thinks you weigh 98 kg! b) the elevator starts to accelerate downwards at 4.0m/s 2 . We’ll handle this part of the question the same way. The only difference is that because the elevator is dropping out from under me, I will push less against the floor. The acceleration of the elevator will be positive. F NET = F g + F a = mg + ma = m ( g + a ) = 75kg ( -9.81m/s 2 + 4.0m/s 2 ) <- both are negative = 75kg (-5.81m/s 2 ) F NET = -4.4e2 N The scale will read... F NET = mg m = F NET / g = (-4.4e2 N) / (-9.81m/s 2 ) m = 44 kg So a regular scale thinks you weigh 44 kg!"

    "html": "Nesting Cycle - NestWatch Skip to Content Area Menu Nesting Cycle Chipping Sparrow nest by Red Wing Birding More than 700 bird species breed in North America, and the variations in their behaviors are fascinating and complex. Different species find mates, build nests, lay eggs, and raise their young in incredibly different ways. This overview is a generalization of the avian nesting cycle. For more information about the nesting cycles of individual birds, visit our guide to common nesting birds . Finding a place to breed Throughout the year, most birds use day length to tell what season it is. When the number of hours of daylight exceeds a certain critical level, physiological changes are triggered in birds which prepare them to breed. Most birds, especially those in temperate regions, also time their breeding activities so that they will be feeding their nestlings when food is most abundant. However, well before nestlings arrive, birds need to select a breeding territory. Non-migratory species may either maintain a territory throughout the winter or establish a new one in the spring. Migratory birds begin looking for and defending a territory as soon as they arrive in the spring. Good territories provide potential nest sites, reliable food sources, and protection from predators. Mountain Chickadee with Nesting Material Photo © Christine Haines Choosing a mate While territories are being claimed, birds try to attract mates. In most species, females choose males based on an assessment of their overall quality and vigor. Males advertise their suitability as a mate by exhibiting bright breeding plumage during courtship displays, by bringing food to females, by demonstrating their nest-building abilities, and by singing, drumming, or calling. Social pair bonds tie males and females of most species together throughout the breeding season, but promiscuity is not uncommon. DNA analyses has shown that even birds that presumably “mate for life,” such as bluebirds, may not always be faithful. It is possible for nestlings in a single nest to be fathered by different males! Males of some species, such as Red-winged Blackbird and House Wren, can have more than one mate at a time (a mating system called polygyny). Much less commonly, females of some species, such as Wilson’s Phalaropes, may have more than one mate as well (polyandry). Nest building Nests provide a safe place for eggs and young birds to develop. Bird nests are extremely diverse, although each species typically has a characteristic nest style. Some birds do not make nests at all and instead lay their eggs in a simple scrape in the ground. Other birds construct nests from natural materials, such as grass, leaves, mud, lichen, and fur, or from human-made materials like paper, plastic, and yarn. Nests can be found almost anywhere – on the ground, in trees, in burrows, on the sides of cliffs, in and on human-made structures, etc. Females typically build nests, but sometimes both parents or just the male will build it. Say's Phoebe Nest with Eggs Photo © Craig Benkman Copulation and egg formation During the breeding season, hormonal changes cause the internal testes of males to swell to more than 1,000 times their normal size. The ovaries and oviduct of females also increase in size in preparation for egg fertilization and development. During copulation, the male’s cloaca contacts and ejects sperm into the cloaca of the female. The sperm travel to the oviduct where they can be stored for long periods. If all goes well, the sperm penetrate through the wall of the ovum (egg) and fertilization takes place. During the first stage of embryonic development, the egg shell develops; pigments are added last. Ovulation and laying take about 24 hours, so female birds typically produce at most one egg per day. Egg laying The total number of eggs that a female can lay in one nesting attempt varies widely depending on the species. For example, many tropical birds lay clutches of only 2 or 3 eggs. Waterfowl, such as Wood Ducks, can lay up to 15 eggs in one nesting attempt. Clutch size can also vary widely among individuals of the same species depending on food and calcium availability, latitude, age of the female, weather, and time of year. The size, shape, color, and texture of bird eggs are also extremely variable both within and among species. Anna's Hummingbird on Nest Photo © Susan Etherton Incubation Birds incubate their eggs to keep them at the proper temperature to ensure normal development. Female songbirds usually begin incubation after they have finished laying all of their eggs so that they will hatch at approximately the same time. Other birds, such as herons, cranes, cormorants, and raptors begin incubation as soon as the first egg is laid and therefore their eggs may hatch on different days. In some species, like Black-headed Grosbeak, both males and females incubate eggs. Incubation time varies depending on the species, but typically the larger the bird, the longer the incubation period. Hello, World Photo © Shailee Shah Hatching Songbirds and most seabirds have altricial young, meaning that the newly hatched birds are blind, featherless, and helpless. Immediately after hatching, altricial birds can do little more than open their mouths to beg for food. They remain in the nest where the parents can feed and protect them while they continue to develop. For the first week of life, most altricial birds cannot control their own body temperature and must be constantly brooded (kept warm) by their parents. By the end of the first week, their eyes are usually open and their feathers are beginning to emerge. During this period, nestlings can experience remarkable growth by doubling their body weight several times! Precocial species, such as ducks and many shorebirds, are born fully feathered, mobile, and with eyes open. Incubation periods are longer for precocial birds than altricial birds, allowing for increased embryonic development in the egg, and therefore they have relatively advanced motor and sensory functions at hatching. Common Mergansers Photo © Kim Acker Feeding the young To keep up with the food demands of nestlings, their parents continuously forage for food. This is an extremely dangerous time for both the adult and young birds because the increased activity and begging cries of nestlings can attract predators. After 2 or 3 weeks, most songbirds are usually ready to leave the nest. Other birds, such as raptors, may stay in the nest for as long as 8 to 10 weeks. In contrast, precocial birds spend hardly any time in the nest and are often seen wandering in search of food alongside their parents only hours after hatching. Leaving the nest Most birds nest only once per year, but some species, like the American Robin, can have up to 4 or 5 nests during a single breeding season. After leaving the nest (fledging) young birds typically remain close to their parents for a short period. During this time, young birds must learn to survive on their own and are very vulnerable to predators and starvation. The first year is the toughest; in nearly all bird species, more than half of the first year birds perish. For birds that do make it to adulthood however, the odds of surviving another year improve greatly. Cancel × Search this website",

    "html": "Multiple Columns in LaTeX | Resurchify Resurchify LaTeX Guide Latex Installation Ubuntu Windows Mac Tutorial Aligning Equations Bibliography Colours Footnotes Glossaries Inserting Images Hyperlinks Multiple Columns Operators Packages Page Numbering Paragraph Formatting Table of Contents LaTeX Symbols Greek Binary Relations Math Arrows Tools LaTeX Compiler Team Work Price Contact Search ☰ Resurchify LaTeX Multiple Columns This tutorial talks about the usage of multiple columns in LaTeX. Text with two or double columns can be created by passing the parameter wocolumn to the document class statement. If you want to create a document with more than two columns, use the package multicol , which has a set of commands for the same. Table of Contents Introduction Column separation Unbalanced columns Inserting floating elements Inserting vertical rulers Creating 2 columns in LaTeX Introduction It is very easy to manage multiple columns in LaTeX. Below is an example demonstrating the use of multicol package to manage multicolumn documents in LaTeX. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 4 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols } \\end { document } Use this line in the preamble to import the package: \\usepackage{multicol} . After this, the multicols environment can be used. It takes two parameters: Number of columns: This parameter is passed inside the braces, and in the example above, the value is 4. Header text: This is inserted inside the square brackets. This parameter is optional and will be displayed on top of the multicolumn text. We can use any LaTeX command here, except for floating elements such as figures and tables. In the example above, we have given the title of the section with a small paragraph. The text which lies between the tags \\begin{multicols} and \\end{multicols} is displayed in multicolumn format. Column separation The separation between the columns is specified by the command \\columnsep Below is an example. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\setlength { \\columnsep }{ 2cm } \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 3 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols } \\end { document } In the example above, the command \\setlength{\\columnsep}{2cm} sets the column separation to 2cm . Unbalanced columns Through the default settings of multicols environment, the text in each column is balanced that is, there is same amount of text in each column. This can be changed by the environment multicols* . 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11 \\begin { multicols* }{ 2 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols* } \\end { document } In the above example, we can see that the text gets printed in a column till we reach the end of the page. After that, the text continues in the next column and so on. Inserting floating elements Floating elements like figures and tables can be inserted in a multicolumn format document with the commands wrapfig and wraptable . 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43 \\begin { multicols }{ 3 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\n \nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\vfill \\begin { wrapfigure }{ l }{ 0.6 \\linewidth } \\includegraphics [width=\\linewidth] { ./sun.jpg } \\caption { Nature’s place } \\end { wrapfigure } This is again some new text here. Just to show you how the..\ntext is getting placed…..\nHope\nyou are able to understand… \\begin { wraptable }{ l }{ 0.6 \\linewidth } \\centering \\begin { tabular }{ |c|c| } \\hline R.No. & Name \\\\ \\hline 1 & John \\\\ 2 & Peter \\\\ 3 & Susie \\\\ 4 & Suzanne \\\\ 5 & Tom \\\\ 6 & Veronica \\\\ \\hline \\end { tabular } \\caption { Table, floating element } \\label { table:ta } \\end { wraptable } \\end { multicols } \\end { document } In the multicol package, floats are poorly supported. Elements inserted within the figure* and table* environments get displayed only at the top or bottom of the next page after they are inserted, and this breaks the layout. Below is a brief overview of the commands. \\usepackage{wrapfig}: This line will import the package wrapfig wrapfigure: This will insert a figure wrapped with the text. wraptable: This is similar to wrapfigure , except that it acts for tables. Inserting vertical rulers A vertical ruler can be inserted as a column separator as shown in the below example. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\usepackage { color } \\usepackage { comment } \\setlength { \\columnseprule }{ 2pt } \\def\\columnseprulecolor { \\color { red }} \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 2 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\n \nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\columnbreak This is again some new text here. Just to show you how the..\ntext is getting placed…..\nHope\nyou are able to understand… \\end { multicols } Some more text here just to show. \\end { document } \\usepackage{color}: This is added in the preamble so that several colours can be used within the document. \\setlength{\\columnseprule}{2pt}: This defines the width of the column separator. It is 0 by default. Here, the width is 2pt. \\def\\columnseprulecolor{\\color{red}}: This sets the colour of the separator line to be red. \\columnbreak: This command inserts a column breakpoint. Creating two columns in LaTeX While writing a research paper,\nyou may need to produce a document with two columns layout in a page.\nTo do so, add twocolumn option in the document class. Use the following command to make double column document: 1 \\documentclass [11pt,twocolumn] { article } Remember, the above command will generate double columns in the entire document. Another way to achieve this is by including the \\usepackage{multicol} package and using the multicols environment. Look at the below sample code to understand the usage: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 \\begin { multicols }{ 2 } Column Nuumber 1 \\columnbreak Column Number 2 \\end { multicols } Two column layout is widely used in writing conference papers, journal papers, books, and articles, etc. Powered by www.resurchify.com",

Text with two or double columns can be created by passing the parameter wocolumn to the document class statement. If you want to create a document with more than two columns, use the package multicol , which has a set of commands for the same. Table of Contents Introduction Column separation Unbalanced columns Inserting floating elements Inserting vertical rulers Creating 2 columns in LaTeX Introduction It is very easy to manage multiple columns in LaTeX. Below is an example demonstrating the use of multicol package to manage multicolumn documents in LaTeX. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 4 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols } \\end { document } Use this line in the preamble to import the package: \\usepackage{multicol} . After this, the multicols environment can be used. It takes two parameters: Number of columns: This parameter is passed inside the braces, and in the example above, the value is 4. Header text: This is inserted inside the square brackets. This parameter is optional and will be displayed on top of the multicolumn text. We can use any LaTeX command here, except for floating elements such as figures and tables. In the example above, we have given the title of the section with a small paragraph. The text which lies between the tags \\begin{multicols} and \\end{multicols} is displayed in multicolumn format. Column separation The separation between the columns is specified by the command \\columnsep Below is an example. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\setlength { \\columnsep }{ 2cm } \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 3 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols } \\end { document } In the example above, the command \\setlength{\\columnsep}{2cm} sets the column separation to 2cm . Unbalanced columns Through the default settings of multicols environment, the text in each column is balanced that is, there is same amount of text in each column. This can be changed by the environment multicols* . 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11 \\begin { multicols* }{ 2 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\end { multicols* } \\end { document } In the above example, we can see that the text gets printed in a column till we reach the end of the page. After that, the text continues in the next column and so on. Inserting floating elements Floating elements like figures and tables can be inserted in a multicolumn format document with the commands wrapfig and wraptable . 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43 \\begin { multicols }{ 3 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\n \nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\vfill \\begin { wrapfigure }{ l }{ 0.6 \\linewidth } \\includegraphics [width=\\linewidth] { ./sun.jpg } \\caption { Nature’s place } \\end { wrapfigure } This is again some new text here. Just to show you how the..\ntext is getting placed…..\nHope\nyou are able to understand… \\begin { wraptable }{ l }{ 0.6 \\linewidth } \\centering \\begin { tabular }{ |c|c| } \\hline R.No. & Name \\\\ \\hline 1 & John \\\\ 2 & Peter \\\\ 3 & Susie \\\\ 4 & Suzanne \\\\ 5 & Tom \\\\ 6 & Veronica \\\\ \\hline \\end { tabular } \\caption { Table, floating element } \\label { table:ta } \\end { wraptable } \\end { multicols } \\end { document } In the multicol package, floats are poorly supported. Elements inserted within the figure* and table* environments get displayed only at the top or bottom of the next page after they are inserted, and this breaks the layout. Below is a brief overview of the commands. \\usepackage{wrapfig}: This line will import the package wrapfig wrapfigure: This will insert a figure wrapped with the text. wraptable: This is similar to wrapfigure , except that it acts for tables. Inserting vertical rulers A vertical ruler can be inserted as a column separator as shown in the below example. 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35 \\documentclass { article } \\usepackage [utf8] { inputenc } \\usepackage [english] { babel } \\usepackage { multicol } \\usepackage { color } \\usepackage { comment } \\setlength { \\columnseprule }{ 2pt } \\def\\columnseprulecolor { \\color { red }} \\begin { document } \\begin { multicols }{ 2 } [ \\section { Section One } This is the first section and we are placing some text here.\n]\n \nNow, we are adding some text here to understand how multiple columns will come up.\nThis way, we hope that you are understanding the multicols package and its usage.\nThe text that we have placed here is only for sample. \\columnbreak This is again some new text here. Just to show you how the..\ntext is getting placed…..\nHope\nyou are able to understand… \\end { multicols } Some more text here just to show. \\end { document } \\usepackage{color}: This is added in the preamble so that several colours can be used within the document. \\setlength{\\columnseprule}{2pt}: This defines the width of the column separator. It is 0 by default. Here, the width is 2pt. \\def\\columnseprulecolor{\\color{red}}: This sets the colour of the separator line to be red. \\columnbreak: This command inserts a column breakpoint. Creating two columns in LaTeX While writing a research paper,\nyou may need to produce a document with two columns layout in a page.\nTo do so, add twocolumn option in the document class. Use the following command to make double column document: 1 \\documentclass [11pt,twocolumn] { article } Remember, the above command will generate double columns in the entire document. Another way to achieve this is by including the \\usepackage{multicol} package and using the multicols environment. Look at the below sample code to understand the usage: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 \\begin { multicols }{ 2 } Column Nuumber 1 \\columnbreak Column Number 2 \\end { multicols } Two column layout is widely used in writing conference papers, journal papers, books, and articles, etc. Powered by www.resurchify.com"

Journal Metrics Overview There are many different journal evaluation metrics produced by several companies, each using different sets of data and time periods for their calculations. Most metrics, and all the metrics discussed below, focus on value for scientific and academic research (citations) and do not take into account other ways content is used (e.g. industrial and commercial applications). The below guide is meant to help authors and readers better understand some of the common metrics used to evaluate journal content. Clarivate Analytics's Journal Citation Reports (JCR) Metrics: Date range: varies Data source: journals indexed in Clarivate Analytics's Web of Science . Impact Factor: A metric meant to indicate the number of times the \"average\" article in the journal is cited. This number is the most widely used metric to evaluate a journal's content. The metric is based on citations in a particular year to articles published over the previous two years . An example of how an Impact Factor is calculated is below. Source: Clarivate Analytics Journal Citation Reports— Optics Express 2012 Impact Factor calculation Total Citations: This is the number of total citations in a given year to all content ever published in a specific journal. Immediacy Index: a measure of how quickly the \"average article\" in a journal is cited. The Immediacy index will tell you how often articles published in a given year are cited within the same year . Cited Half-life: This figure is the median age of the articles cited in the given year. For example, in JCR 2012, Optics Letters has a cited half-life of 6.5 years. That means that articles published in Optics Letters between July 2006 and December 2012 account for 50% of all citations to Optics Letters articles in 2012. Eigenfactor Score: a metric based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the current year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals. References from one article in a journal to another article from the same journal are removed, so that Eigenfactor Scores are not influenced by journal self-citation. Article Influence: determines the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years after publication. It is calculated by dividing a journal's Eigenfactor Score by the number of articles in the journal, normalized as a fraction of all articles in all publications. The mean Article Influence Score is 1.00 . A score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has above-average influence. A score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence. Journal Citation Indicator (JCI): The average Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI) of citable items (articles & reviews) published by a journal over a recent three year period. The average JCI in a category is 1. Journals with a JCI of 1.5 have 50% more citation impact than the average in that category. It may be used alongside other metrics to help you evaluate journals. Google Scholar Metrics: Date range: articles published between 2019 and 2023 and citations as of July 2024. Data source: all articles indexed in Google Scholar . h-index: The h-index of a publication is the largest number h such that at least h articles in that publication were cited at least h times each. For example, a publication with five articles cited by, respectively, 17, 9, 6, 3, and 2, has the h-index of 3. h-core: The h-core of a publication is a set of top cited h articles from the publication. These are the articles that the h-index is based on. For example, the publication above has the h-core with three articles, those cited by 17, 9, and 6. h-median: The h-median of a publication is the median of the citation counts in its h-core. For example, the h-median of the publication above is 9. The h-median is a measure of the distribution of citations to the articles in the h-core. Finally, the h5-index , h5-core , and h5-median of a publication are, respectively, the h-index, h-core, and h-median of only those of its articles that were published in the last five complete calendar years.

The mean Article Influence Score is 1.00 . A score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has above-average influence. A score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence. Journal Citation Indicator (JCI): The average Category Normalized Citation Impact (CNCI) of citable items (articles & reviews) published by a journal over a recent three year period. The average JCI in a category is 1. Journals with a JCI of 1.5 have 50% more citation impact than the average in that category. It may be used alongside other metrics to help you evaluate journals. Google Scholar Metrics: Date range: articles published between 2019 and 2023 and citations as of July 2024. Data source: all articles indexed in Google Scholar . h-index: The h-index of a publication is the largest number h such that at least h articles in that publication were cited at least h times each. For example, a publication with five articles cited by, respectively, 17, 9, 6, 3, and 2, has the h-index of 3. h-core: The h-core of a publication is a set of top cited h articles from the publication. These are the articles that the h-index is based on. For example, the publication above has the h-core with three articles, those cited by 17, 9, and 6. h-median: The h-median of a publication is the median of the citation counts in its h-core. For example, the h-median of the publication above is 9. The h-median is a measure of the distribution of citations to the articles in the h-core. Finally, the h5-index , h5-core , and h5-median of a publication are, respectively, the h-index, h-core, and h-median of only those of its articles that were published in the last five complete calendar years.

Lactic acid fermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration where sugars (primarily glucose) are converted into cellular energy and lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) or other microorganisms. The biotechnological production of lactic acid through fermentation offers a substantial advantage over chemical synthesis in that it can utilize cost-effective raw materials, including glucose, starchy residue, cellulosic, and other carbohydrate-rich materials. The cost of raw materials is a significant factor to consider in the economic production of lactic acid. However, the ultimate efficiency and economics of lactic acid fermentation remain a challenge from numerous perspectives, and media compositions are crucial in the enhancement of this process. Additionally, the biotechnological production of lactic acid provides numerous advantages over chemical synthesis, including low substrate costs, low production temperatures, and low energy consumption, in addition to the high product specificity that is achieved by producing a desired optically pure l-(+)- or d-(−)-lactic acid.

(Ahmad A., et al ., 2020) Lactic acid fermentation equation The basic chemical equation for Lactic acid fermentation, where glucose is converted into lactic acid, is as follows: C 6 H 12 O 6 (glucose)→2C 3 H 6 O 3 (lactic acid) +2 ATP. Comparison of chemical and fermentation production of enantiopure lactic acid. (Hoyos P., et al ., 2017) Lactic acid fermentation examples Several well-known fermented food items rely heavily on lactic acid fermentation as part of their manufacturing processes: Yogurt : Lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, ferment lactose, or milk sugar, to produce lactic acid, which is then used to make yogurt. This gives the yogurt its distinct sour flavor in addition to thickening the milk by inducing proteins to coagulate. Sauerkraut : Finely shredded cabbage undergoes fermentation by Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and other lactic acid bacteria, resulting in the production of lactic acid. This acid serves to preserve the cabbage and imparts a sour flavor. Kimchi : A conventional Korean fermented vegetable dish, usually prepared with napa cabbage, subjected to fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), resulting in its signature sour and spicy taste. Pickles : Cucumbers undergo lactic acid fermentation, a process in which lactic acid bacteria decompose carbohydrates into lactic acid, therefore preserving the pickles and imparting their distinctive sour taste. Sourdough Bread : Lactic acid bacteria and yeast are both necessary for the fermentation of dough in sourdough bread, which results in the production of lactic acid and gives the bread its unique sour flavor. Kefir : It is a fermented milk beverage created by infusing milk with kefir grains, which contain a symbiotic culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. Lactose is fermented into lactic acid, carbon dioxide, and trace quantities of ethanol, yielding a sour, slightly effervescent beverage high in probiotics. Kefir is recognized for its digestive advantages and is simpler to digest for people who are lactose intolerant since lactose is broken down during the fermentation process. Fermented Fish : In certain civilizations, fish is preserved via lactic acid fermentation. Surströmming, a Swedish delicacy, is prepared by fermenting Baltic herring with salt, allowing lactic acid bacteria to convert the fish's carbohydrates into lactic acid. Another example is pla-ra, a Thai fermented fish product that is fermented with lactic acid in a saltwater brine. These fermented fish items have a strong, pungent odor and a characteristic sour flavor. Applications of fermentation technology at BOC Sciences Fermentation in Pharmaceuticals Fermentation for Special Small Molecules Fermentation in Human Nutrition Fermentation in Animal Health Fermentation in Agriculture Fermentation for Pigments Fermentation for Feed Additives Benefits of lactic acid fermentation Preservation : Lactic acid fermentation has been used to preserve food for many millennia. Lactic acid generation lowers the pH of the food, resulting in an acidic environment that prevents the growth of hazardous pathogens and spoilage organisms, increasing the shelf life of fermented items without the need for refrigeration or artificial preservatives. Improved digestive health : Lactic acid fermentation produces foods that are high in probiotics, which are helpful microorganisms that maintain a healthy gut microbiota. Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut can help balance gut flora, increase digestion, and alleviate the symptoms of digestive diseases like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation. Enhanced nutrient absorption : Lactic acid fermentation can improve nutritional bioavailability by converting complicated molecules into more digestible ones. For example, the fermentation of soybeans in products like tempeh increases the availability of protein and some vitamins (such as B vitamins), making them easier to absorb. Boosted immune function : Lactic acid-fermented foods can boost immune function by increasing gut health, which is critical for immunological control. Probiotics included in fermented foods can improve the intestinal barrier, preventing dangerous bacteria from entering the body and generating an immune response. Reduction of antinutrients : Antinutritional elements like phytic acid and lectins, which can prevent the absorption of crucial minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron, are decreased by lactic acid fermentation. For instance, these antinutrient levels are lowered during the fermentation of grains and legumes, which enhances overall nutrition by facilitating improved mineral absorption. Flavor and texture enhancement : Foods that undergo lactic acid fermentation acquire a distinct sour flavor that can improve the flavor profile of a variety of cuisines. Food texture can also be enhanced, as seen by the tangy, crisp pickled veggies or the creamy, yogurt-like consistency. Lactose reduction in dairy products : Lactose, the sugar present in milk, is broken down into lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation process of dairy products. For those who are lactose intolerant, this procedure improves the digestion of fermented dairy products like kefir and yogurt.

The goal of Aston’s research was to find a way to separate atoms efficiently. In general, mass spectrometers are relatively simple to use. The lab technician merely inserts the substance into the machine’s chamber, which then overwhelms the atoms with electrons and turns the atoms into ions—formally called ionization. Once the ionization process is complete, the ions rapidly exit the chamber and enter an electric field, which accelerates the ions at various speeds. The faster ions indicate a higher electrical charge, which allows the lab technician to separate the substance accordingly. The electrically charged ions then enter a magnetic field and curve according to their charge. Stronger-charged ions will bend more dramatically than lesser-charged ions. It’s important to have a general understanding of how mass spectrometry works before learning how it helps everyday life for millions of people around the world. Below, our experts discuss the many applications of mass spectrometry. Read on to learn more. Forensic science Forensics frequently uses mass spectrometry because the process helps scientists recognize and analyze chemicals that wouldn’t normally be present. Most mass spectrometry applications in forensics involve analyzing crime scene evidence. The lab technician can analyze, for example, small particles from the fibers in carpeting to make an educated decision against a criminal. Additionally, mass spectrometers are among the best tools to use during an arson investigation. By collecting samples from the presumed arson crime scene, forensic scientists can use mass spectrometry to determine if there was a fuel source in the debris. Furthermore, mass spectrometry is one of several analytical instruments used to develop a toxicology report that can help officials determine if foul play has taken place. Food analysis Everyone needs food to survive, but the food must be safe to consume. Mass spectrometry helps lab technicians make decisions about the quality of meats, fish, nuts, produce, and nonperishable goods. One challenge many food companies encounter is contamination; even if they have an immaculate facility, contamination is still possible. Mass spectrometry helps lab technicians identify contamination from factors such as pesticides in produce or spoilage in meat and fish. Furthermore, mass spectrometers are one of the analytical instruments used to determine the nutritional quality of food. Mass spectrometry—often paired with liquid chromatography—allows lab technicians to identify food’s nutritional makeup, such as proteins and vitamins. Pharmaceutical analysis Because mass spectrometry measures the molecular weight of a particular substance or compound, technicians in pharmaceutical labs frequently use mass spectrometry to determine the molecular formula in pharmaceutical drugs. Additionally, mass spectrometry—among other analytical instruments—provides insight into new pharmaceutical discoveries. Through mass spectrometry, lab technicians can determine if a pharmaceutical drug is safe to go to market or not, but of course, the lab doesn’t make the final decision. Before any pharmaceutical drug reaches the general market, the FDA requires numerous tests and a thorough report that includes data proving the drug works as advertised. That said, mass spectrometry is vital in the early stages of pharmaceutical development because it allows scientists to proceed with the preclinical development phase. With the aid of mass spectrometers, lab technicians can proceed with pharmacokinetic analyses, metabolite screening, and any tests required by the FDA. Environmental science Mass spectrometry has several applications in environmental science. Starting with geology, lab technicians can analyze rocks and soil to determine a rock sample’s history. The lab might find traces of petroleum or fragments of ions to understand the rock’s components in detail. Additionally, mass spectrometry is common in agricultural applications to assess the quality of a farm’s soil, in addition to testing and quantifying pesticides. Furthermore, scientists can analyze the purity and components of drinking water on a commercial level to ensure it meets FDA regulations. Finally, modern mass spectrometers are complex enough to determine and measure the isotopes in solar wind. Although mass spectrometry is a common method to measure the environment and atmosphere on Earth, officials don’t restrict mass spectrometry to Earth. Space science NASA regularly uses mass spectrometers to analyze crucial factors in space travel, such as bioastronautics and microgravity. Without mass spectrometry, NASA couldn’t measure the result of microgravity on human bones or the oxygen and hydrogen in the universe. Furthermore, with mass spectrometry, NASA was able to analyze Saturn’s atmosphere, including vital factors such as oxygen and toxins on the planet. But Saturn wasn’t the first planet NASA explored. In the 1970s NASA launched the Viking Project, the United States’ first mission in which they successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars. One of the outcomes of the Viking Project allowed NASA to successfully analyze Martian soil. In other words, it’s safe to say there are many applications of mass spectrometry. Whether you’re working for NASA, at a pharmaceutical company, in a research university, or in a forensic science lab, you’re going to use mass spectrometry frequently. But mass spectrometry doesn’t only apply to the individuals operating the machines; everyone on the other side of the machine benefits from it too. For instance, people want to know the food they consume is safe and the nutrition labels are accurate, and mass spectrometry gives them peace of mind. We all depend on mass spectrometry one way or another, and if you’re the manager of a lab, you know how important having quality equipment is. Unfortunately, many analytical instruments are very expensive and laboratories find themselves either purchasing low-quality equipment to save money or not purchasing the equipment at all.

Furthermore, scientists can analyze the purity and components of drinking water on a commercial level to ensure it meets FDA regulations. Finally, modern mass spectrometers are complex enough to determine and measure the isotopes in solar wind. Although mass spectrometry is a common method to measure the environment and atmosphere on Earth, officials don’t restrict mass spectrometry to Earth. Space science NASA regularly uses mass spectrometers to analyze crucial factors in space travel, such as bioastronautics and microgravity. Without mass spectrometry, NASA couldn’t measure the result of microgravity on human bones or the oxygen and hydrogen in the universe. Furthermore, with mass spectrometry, NASA was able to analyze Saturn’s atmosphere, including vital factors such as oxygen and toxins on the planet. But Saturn wasn’t the first planet NASA explored. In the 1970s NASA launched the Viking Project, the United States’ first mission in which they successfully landed a spacecraft on Mars. One of the outcomes of the Viking Project allowed NASA to successfully analyze Martian soil. In other words, it’s safe to say there are many applications of mass spectrometry. Whether you’re working for NASA, at a pharmaceutical company, in a research university, or in a forensic science lab, you’re going to use mass spectrometry frequently. But mass spectrometry doesn’t only apply to the individuals operating the machines; everyone on the other side of the machine benefits from it too. For instance, people want to know the food they consume is safe and the nutrition labels are accurate, and mass spectrometry gives them peace of mind. We all depend on mass spectrometry one way or another, and if you’re the manager of a lab, you know how important having quality equipment is. Unfortunately, many analytical instruments are very expensive and laboratories find themselves either purchasing low-quality equipment to save money or not purchasing the equipment at all.

This Poisson calculator finds the probability of any event using the Poisson random variables (x) and average rate of success (λ) at different types of probabilities with the detailed steps in seconds. What is Poisson distribution? Poisson distribution is a theoretical distribution that is a good approximation to the binomial distribution when the probability is small and the number of trials is large. In probability theory and statistics, it describes the probability of any event occurring within a fixed interval of time in the Poisson experiment. The occurrence of any event is independent with respect to time at any constant rate. The Poisson distribution is named on behalf of the remarkable work on discrete probability distribution by the French mathematician Simeon Denis Poisson. It plays an important role in determining the probability of several random variables by using the Poisson probability distribution on which the data is separated for scaling. Poisson Distribution Formula The formula of the Poisson distribution of random variables for the average rate of occurrence of any event in a specific interval of time can be stated as: P(x) = (e −λ × λ x ) / x!​ “ e ” is Euler’s constant ( e = 2.718 ). “ λ ” expected number of events (average rate of occurrence). “ X ” observed number of events (Poisson random variable). Moreover, to find the probability of any event use our Poisson calculator, by just entering the value in the given input fields. Poisson Distribution Example: In this section, we'll learn the steps for calculating the probability using the Poisson distribution method.

P (1) = 0.27073 P (2) = {(2.718) −(2) × (2) 2 ​} / 2! P (2) = 0.54144 / 2 P (x = 2) = 0.27073 P (x ≤ 2) = P (0) + P (1) + p (2) P (x ≤ 2) = 0.67682 To verify the all above results use the above Poisson distribution calculator that provides the answer with detailed steps.

We all know what gravity does – drop a bowling ball on your foot and you surely know the answer. But what made it drop in the first place? In 1687, Isaac Newton stated the gravitational force to be proportional to the product of two masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton developed the equation to model gravity but had no explanation for the cause of gravity. In 1915, Albert Einstein refined gravity with General Relativity and described gravity as the warping of spacetime . Many years after Einstein, the Standard Model of particle physics evolved and theorized that the graviton particle is what interacts between two bodies (made of particles) to determine the force of attraction. Although the equations work, there is no evidence of the graviton despite experiments to find it and explain why gravity is so weak compared to other forces. Furthermore, gravity has not been united with other forces. Explanation Gravity is a result of traveling, longitudinal waves that are absorbed by particles. Particles consist of standing waves of energy, made of in-waves that convert to out-waves. However, the out-wave amplitude is slightly less than in-wave amplitude after energy is absorbed and transferred to transverse wave energy for the spin of a particle (consistent with conservation of energy laws in physics). In the absence of other forces , two particles would be attractive due to the rule that particles move to minimize wave amplitude , which is now lower between two particles. Other forces do have to be considered, however, and the amplitude loss is very, very small compared to constructive and destructive longitudinal wave interference that is the cause of the electric force . Consider these examples of gravity versus the electric force. Electron + Electron – Electric force dominates due to constructive wave interference and the attractive force of gravity is indistinguishable . Electron + Hydrogen Atom – The hydrogen atom is electrically neutral due to destructive wave interference. An electron has a very small attraction on the order of 10 -37 , which is still indistinguishable from the electric force. Electron + Large Body – A large body contains many atoms that are electrically neutral due to destructive wave interference. The cumulative effect of amplitude loss from all particle spin now makes gravity distinguishable from the electric force when there are many, many atoms (e.g. it takes an accumulated amplitude loss of 10 37 hydrogen atoms to equal the force of just a single electron’s electrical force). Large Bodies The electric force dominates wave center movement until the summation of amplitude loss in a collection of particles, e.g. large bodies like planets, is greater than the effect of the electric force. Most large bodies consist of atoms that are neutral (protons and electrons), such that there is negligible constructive or destructive wave interference on bodies consisting of atoms. In this case, gravity is the force that controls large bodies due to the reduction of amplitude. The larger the number of particles in a body, the greater its amplitude loss. Amplitude is also reduced by the square of the distance naturally, so distance also affects the force of attraction. A large body with a significant loss of longitudinal out-wave energy Shading Effect Gravity isn’t typically measured by a single particle.  It’s the effect of two bodies with mass, producing a shading effect of the electric force.  The collective amplitude of all the particles in a body have been reduced as it passes through a body and is shaded between the two bodies.  In the illustration below, longitudinal wave energy on Body A is partially absorbed, leading to less wave amplitude on Body B from its left side. Likewise, longitudinal wave energy on Body B is partially absorbed, leading to less wave amplitude on Body A from its right side. This is a shading effect. And when the net force is greater on one side of an object, it will move in the direction of the force (amplitude is higher on one side and it seeks the direction of minimal amplitude). Like all of the forces, particles are moving to minimize their amplitude. Thus, Body A and Body B will be attracted to each other. Gravitation is not a “pull” force. It’s actually a “push” force. It’s the result of shading and unequal pressure. This is gravity.  Traveling, longitudinal waves that convert some of their energy (amplitude) to magnetic spin as it passes through a body.  Two bodies produce a shading effect and particles then move to minimize their amplitude. Conservation of Energy In the section on the magnetic force and in further detail in the Forces paper, the electron’s spin was found to derive the Bohr magneton , thereby associating the increased spin energy to the decreased longitudinal energy associated with gravity. It is a conservation of energy from longitudinal wave form to transverse wave form. In other words, as the magnetic wave is created, it reduces energy from the electric wave causing gravity. The reduction is very small for  single particles. The ratio of the electric force amplitude compared to the amplitude loss experienced by gravity is 2.4 x 10 -43 for the electron and 8.1 x 10 -37 for the proton. A single particle with a very slight loss of longitudinal out-wave energy Equation In simple terms using two groups (Q) of particles separated at distance (r), the properties of the electron’s energy and radius (E e and r e ), and the force of gravity for a proton (⍺ Gp ) is shown below.  It is simply the electric force with an amplitude adjustment for the loss of energy in the proton’s out-wave. Gravitational Force Using classical constants Using energy wave constants The derivation of the gravitational force requires multiple steps to arrive at the gravitational loss of the proton (⍺ Gp ), instead of the electron. For the detailed steps, refer to the Forces paper. Large Body Particle Count To use the gravitational force equation, the number of particles must be estimated for large bodies such that the total amplitude loss for the body can be obtained. The variable Q is used to estimate nucleons, as an atom contains protons and neutrons in the nucleus (nucleons) and electrons in orbit. The mass of the proton and neutron are much greater than the electron, so nucleons are used in the estimate. Each proton is normally paired with an electron anyway, and since the neutron is roughly the mass of a proton plus an electron, using a nucleon count with the amplitude loss of the proton turns out to be a very good estimate of particle counts and amplitude loss in a large body. Thus, to estimate the number of nucleons (Q) in a group, or large body, the following is equation is used. The mass of the group is divided by the mass of the proton. For example the mass of the Sun is divided by the proton mass. When the nucleon estimates for each large body is used in the Gravitational Force equation, the results are quite accurate despite a method that is used to approximate the number of particles. The results are seen in the gravitational calculations. Particle Count (Q) for Large Bodies Proof Proof of the energy wave explanation for the gravitational force is the derivations and calculations of: Derived Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation Derived the gravitational constant (G) Calculations of gravitational forces – see example calculation below Earth and Moon Gravitational Force – Calculation In this example, the force of gravity of the Earth on the Moon is calculated. To do this, the Particle Count for Large Bodies equation (see above) is used to estimate the number of nucleon particles (Q) that will be used in the Gravitational Force equation. First, the estimated nucleons are calculated for both the Earth and the Moon. The mass of each is inserted into the numerator and the mass of the proton is inserted into the denominator to solve for nucleon count. The calculation is shown with the gravitational force equation in two formats (classical constants and wave constants). m earth = 5.972 x 10 24 kg m moon = 7.34767 x 10 22 kg m p = 1.67262 x 10 -27 kg Result: Earth Nucleon Count (Q earth ): 3.570E51 particles Result: Moon Nucleon Count (Q moon ): 4.393E49 particles Variables: Q 1 = Q earth = 3.570E51 ( from above ) Q 2 = Q moon = 4.393E49 ( from above ) r = 3.85E8 m (distance between Earth and Moon ) Equation #1: Gravitational Force Equation – Classical Format Result: 1.975E20 newtons (kg m/s 2 ) Equation #2: Gravitational Force Equation – Wave Format Result: 1.976E20 newtons (kg m/s 2 ) Comments: There is no difference to an accuracy level of 0.00% from Newton’s law of universal gravitation for either format.

We all know what gravity does – drop a bowling ball on your foot and you surely know the answer. But what made it drop in the first place? In 1687, Isaac Newton stated the gravitational force to be proportional to the product of two masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton developed the equation to model gravity but had no explanation for the cause of gravity. In 1915, Albert Einstein refined gravity with General Relativity and described gravity as the warping of spacetime . Many years after Einstein, the Standard Model of particle physics evolved and theorized that the graviton particle is what interacts between two bodies (made of particles) to determine the force of attraction. Although the equations work, there is no evidence of the graviton despite experiments to find it and explain why gravity is so weak compared to other forces. Furthermore, gravity has not been united with other forces. Explanation Gravity is a result of traveling, longitudinal waves that are absorbed by particles. Particles consist of standing waves of energy, made of in-waves that convert to out-waves. However, the out-wave amplitude is slightly less than in-wave amplitude after energy is absorbed and transferred to transverse wave energy for the spin of a particle (consistent with conservation of energy laws in physics). In the absence of other forces , two particles would be attractive due to the rule that particles move to minimize wave amplitude , which is now lower between two particles. Other forces do have to be considered, however, and the amplitude loss is very, very small compared to constructive and destructive longitudinal wave interference that is the cause of the electric force . Consider these examples of gravity versus the electric force. Electron + Electron – Electric force dominates due to constructive wave interference and the attractive force of gravity is indistinguishable . Electron + Hydrogen Atom – The hydrogen atom is electrically neutral due to destructive wave interference. An electron has a very small attraction on the order of 10 -37 , which is still indistinguishable from the electric force. Electron + Large Body – A large body contains many atoms that are electrically neutral due to destructive wave interference. The cumulative effect of amplitude loss from all particle spin now makes gravity distinguishable from the electric force when there are many, many atoms (e.g. it takes an accumulated amplitude loss of 10 37 hydrogen atoms to equal the force of just a single electron’s electrical force). Large Bodies The electric force dominates wave center movement until the summation of amplitude loss in a collection of particles, e.g. large bodies like planets, is greater than the effect of the electric force. Most large bodies consist of atoms that are neutral (protons and electrons), such that there is negligible constructive or destructive wave interference on bodies consisting of atoms. In this case, gravity is the force that controls large bodies due to the reduction of amplitude. The larger the number of particles in a body, the greater its amplitude loss. Amplitude is also reduced by the square of the distance naturally, so distance also affects the force of attraction. A large body with a significant loss of longitudinal out-wave energy Shading Effect Gravity isn’t typically measured by a single particle.  It’s the effect of two bodies with mass, producing a shading effect of the electric force.  The collective amplitude of all the particles in a body have been reduced as it passes through a body and is shaded between the two bodies.  In the illustration below, longitudinal wave energy on Body A is partially absorbed, leading to less wave amplitude on Body B from its left side. Likewise, longitudinal wave energy on Body B is partially absorbed, leading to less wave amplitude on Body A from its right side. This is a shading effect. And when the net force is greater on one side of an object, it will move in the direction of the force (amplitude is higher on one side and it seeks the direction of minimal amplitude). Like all of the forces, particles are moving to minimize their amplitude. Thus, Body A and Body B will be attracted to each other. Gravitation is not a “pull” force. It’s actually a “push” force. It’s the result of shading and unequal pressure. This is gravity.  Traveling, longitudinal waves that convert some of their energy (amplitude) to magnetic spin as it passes through a body.  Two bodies produce a shading effect and particles then move to minimize their amplitude. Conservation of Energy In the section on the magnetic force and in further detail in the Forces paper, the electron’s spin was found to derive the Bohr magneton , thereby associating the increased spin energy to the decreased longitudinal energy associated with gravity. It is a conservation of energy from longitudinal wave form to transverse wave form. In other words, as the magnetic wave is created, it reduces energy from the electric wave causing gravity. The reduction is very small for  single particles. The ratio of the electric force amplitude compared to the amplitude loss experienced by gravity is 2.4 x 10 -43 for the electron and 8.1 x 10 -37 for the proton. A single particle with a very slight loss of longitudinal out-wave energy Equation In simple terms using two groups (Q) of particles separated at distance (r), the properties of the electron’s energy and radius (E e and r e ), and the force of gravity for a proton (⍺ Gp ) is shown below.  It is simply the electric force with an amplitude adjustment for the loss of energy in the proton’s out-wave. Gravitational Force Using classical constants Using energy wave constants The derivation of the gravitational force requires multiple steps to arrive at the gravitational loss of the proton (⍺ Gp ), instead of the electron. For the detailed steps, refer to the Forces paper. Large Body Particle Count To use the gravitational force equation, the number of particles must be estimated for large bodies such that the total amplitude loss for the body can be obtained. The variable Q is used to estimate nucleons, as an atom contains protons and neutrons in the nucleus (nucleons) and electrons in orbit.

Each proton is normally paired with an electron anyway, and since the neutron is roughly the mass of a proton plus an electron, using a nucleon count with the amplitude loss of the proton turns out to be a very good estimate of particle counts and amplitude loss in a large body. Thus, to estimate the number of nucleons (Q) in a group, or large body, the following is equation is used. The mass of the group is divided by the mass of the proton. For example the mass of the Sun is divided by the proton mass. When the nucleon estimates for each large body is used in the Gravitational Force equation, the results are quite accurate despite a method that is used to approximate the number of particles. The results are seen in the gravitational calculations.

Full details are in the privacy policy . Got it Ideal Gases Properties and behaviour of ideal gases Quantitative experiments have shown that the pressure, volume and temperature of a fixed amount of gas are related by fairly simple laws. For example, for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume are inversely proportional to each other. Such relations are only followed by gases at high temperatures and low pressures, far from the conditions under which they condense to a liquid. Room temperature and atmospheric pressure is sufficient for many gases. It is useful, however, to define an ideal gas as one that would follow such laws at all temperatures and pressures. On a molecular level, such a gas would have the following properties: the gas particles occupy a negligible fraction of the total volume there is no long range attraction between the particles all collisions are elastic GCSE Part A Gas laws Within a closed system and for a fixed amount of gas, ideal gases follow the following laws: Boyle's Law - The product of pressure and volume is constant for a fixed temperature. p V = const. Figure 1: There are a family of curves with p V = const. Charles' Law - The ratio of volume and temperature is constant for a fixed pressure. T V ​ = const. where T is measured in kelvin. Figure 2: There are a family of curves with T V ​ = const. Pressure Law - The ratio of pressure and temperature is constant for a fixed volume. T p ​ = const. where T is measured in kelvin. Figure 3: There are a family of curves with T p ​ = const. A Level Part B Partial pressure The partial pressure of a component i in an ideal gas mixture p i ​ is the same as the pressure that component would exert if it was alone in the same volume. So, the partial pressure of each component is given by product of the total pressure p and the molar fraction of the component ( x i ​ = n n i ​ ​ with n = ∑ n i ​ ). p i ​ = x i ​ p The sum of the partial pressures of all the k components gives the total pressure (Dalton's Law). p = i = 1 ∑ k ​ p i ​ For ideal gases, the total pressure does not depend on the nature of the components . So, a mixture of ideal gases can be treated the same as a single ideal gas. MCQ Q1 Loading... Loading... A Level Part C Ideal gas law Observed experimental laws lead to the idea that an ideal gas follows the ideal gas law: p V = n RT where p is the pressure in Pa , V is the volume in m 3 , n the number of moles, T the absolute temperature in K , and R = 8.3145 J K − 1 mo l − 1 the gas constant. This is a compilation of the historic Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Pressure law, which each relate two of the three variables, p , V and T , (for a fixed mass of gas), while keeping the other constant. Quick Q1 What is the pressure of 2 mol of hydrogen in a 4 d m 3 container at 300 K ? Show answer A Level Part D Pressure from kinetic theory Kinetic theory tries to explain the large-scale macroscopic properties of the gas via the microscopic motion of the particles which make up the gas. Thus pressure inside a container is due to the particles colliding with the walls of the container; the momentum change of the particles as they bounce off produces a reaction force on the wall. When a particle strikes a wall, as in the diagram below (in 2D), the component of its velocity perpendicular to the wall is reversed, whereas that parallel to the wall is maintained. Thus the impulse on the wall of the collision below is 2 m v x ​ . Figure 4: Particle colliding with container wall If you consider a rectangular box, as in Figure 5 , the time taken between collisions on a wall is t = v n ​ 2 l n ​ ​ . Here v n ​ is the speed in the direction of l n ​ . As number of collisions in a time T is t T ​ Thus: Total impulse of one particle = I 1 ​ = number of collisions × impulse of each collision = 2 l n ​ T v n ​ ​ × 2 m v n ​ = l n ​ T m v n ​ 2 ​ Figure 5: The rectangular box used in the derivation above. l n ​ can refer to any side lengths: l x ​ , l y ​ or l z ​ . If you assume there are N particles inside the box and they do not collide with each other (they occupy a negligible fraction of the container volume), you can expand this one particle treatment to many particles. Thus there will always be a total average force f acting on the wall over the time T over which the total impulse I tot ​ is calculated. (Impulse is cumulative over time). The total impulse I tot ​ is given by: I tot ​ = N ⟨ I 1 ​ ⟩ N.B. we have to take the mean of the impulse ( ⟨ I 1 ​ ⟩ ) as the particles in the gas are moving at different speeds and ⟨ f ⟩ T = l n ​ NT m ⟨ v n 2 ​ ⟩ ​ so ⟨ f ⟩ = l n ​ N m ⟨ v n 2 ​ ⟩ ​ Because the particles do not prefer velocity in one direction to the other, ⟨ v n 2 ​ ⟩ can be related to the root mean square speed, c rms ​ = ⟨ c 2 ⟩ ​ of the particles. ⟨ c 2 ⟩ = ⟨ v x 2 ​ ⟩ + ⟨ v y 2 ​ ⟩ + ⟨ v z 2 ​ ⟩ = 3 ⟨ v n 2 ​ ⟩ Pressure = Force ÷ Area Therefore: p = 3 l x ​ l y ​ l z ​ N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ ​ = 3 V N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ ​ = 3 1 ​ ρ ⟨ c 2 ⟩ This is true for all walls and any shape of container.

Density of neon: ρ = 0.900 kg m − 3 Atmospheric pressure: p = 1.01 × 1 0 5 Pa Show answer A Level Part E Energy from kinetic theory Using the relationship derived in the previous section, Pressure from kinetic theory: p = 3 1 ​ ρ ⟨ c 2 ⟩ a formula which can be used to calculate the internal energy of the gas using only its macroscopic properties can be derived. Internal energy is the energy associated with the random motion of particles in a body on a microscopic level. It includes both kinetic energy and the potential energy arising from the forces between the particles in the body. For an ideal gas there is no potential energy term. p = 3 1 ​ ρ ⟨ c 2 ⟩ = 3 V N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ ​ where N is the number of particles in the gas and m is the mass of each particle. Thus: p V = 3 1 ​ N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ As the gas is ideal we can substitute the ideal gas law, p V = n RT into this equation: n RT = 3 1 ​ N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ and introducing a numerical factor 2 3 ​ to both sides, 2 3 ​ n RT = 2 1 ​ N m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ = N × 2 1 ​ m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ Now the term, 2 1 ​ m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ , is the mean kinetic energy of a gas particle. This times the number of gas molecules, N is the total kinetic energy of the gas.\nThe number of moles of gas, n , is related to the number of particles, N , by the formula, N = n N A ​ where N A ​ is Avogadro's number. So for a particle we can write 2 3 ​ RT = 2 1 ​ N A ​ m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ or 2 1 ​ m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ = 2 3 ​ N A ​ R ​ T Now as the gas is ideal, there are no interactions between the gas particles. Thus the gas particles have no potential energy associated with forces between the gas particles, and so the only contribution to the internal energy U is from the kinetic energy. Therefore: U = 2 1 ​ m ⟨ c 2 ⟩ × N = 2 3 ​ n RT The formula, U = 2 3 ​ n RT , thus relates the internal energy of the gas to the macroscopic properties temperature, T , and number of moles, n . It also shows that U ∝ T which gives an interpretation of temperature for a gas; it is a measure of the average kinetic energy of a molecule.

We substitute: ⟨ c 2 ⟩ = M 3 RT ​ Finally, we can define the root mean squared speed v rms ​ as the square root of ⟨ c 2 ⟩ : c rms ​ = ⟨ c 2 ⟩ ​ = M 3 RT ​ ​ It is sometimes called the average speed, but it is the RMS average and not the mean. As you can see, this average speed is proportional to the square root of temperature. Thus, increasing the temperature will increase the average speed as a result of increasing the mean kinetic energy.

Full details are in the privacy policy . Got it Ideal Gases Properties and behaviour of ideal gases Quantitative experiments have shown that the pressure, volume and temperature of a fixed amount of gas are related by fairly simple laws. For example, for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure and volume are inversely proportional to each other. Such relations are only followed by gases at high temperatures and low pressures, far from the conditions under which they condense to a liquid. Room temperature and atmospheric pressure is sufficient for many gases. It is useful, however, to define an ideal gas as one that would follow such laws at all temperatures and pressures. On a molecular level, such a gas would have the following properties: the gas particles occupy a negligible fraction of the total volume there is no long range attraction between the particles all collisions are elastic GCSE Part A Gas laws Within a closed system and for a fixed amount of gas, ideal gases follow the following laws: Boyle's Law - The product of pressure and volume is constant for a fixed temperature. p V = const. Figure 1: There are a family of curves with p V = const. Charles' Law - The ratio of volume and temperature is constant for a fixed pressure. T V ​ = const. where T is measured in kelvin. Figure 2: There are a family of curves with T V ​ = const. Pressure Law - The ratio of pressure and temperature is constant for a fixed volume. T p ​ = const. where T is measured in kelvin. Figure 3: There are a family of curves with T p ​ = const. A Level Part B Partial pressure The partial pressure of a component i in an ideal gas mixture p i ​ is the same as the pressure that component would exert if it was alone in the same volume. So, the partial pressure of each component is given by product of the total pressure p and the molar fraction of the component ( x i ​ = n n i ​ ​ with n = ∑ n i ​ ). p i ​ = x i ​ p The sum of the partial pressures of all the k components gives the total pressure (Dalton's Law). p = i = 1 ∑ k ​ p i ​ For ideal gases, the total pressure does not depend on the nature of the components . So, a mixture of ideal gases can be treated the same as a single ideal gas. MCQ Q1 Loading... Loading... A Level Part C Ideal gas law Observed experimental laws lead to the idea that an ideal gas follows the ideal gas law: p V = n RT where p is the pressure in Pa , V is the volume in m 3 , n the number of moles, T the absolute temperature in K , and R = 8.3145 J K − 1 mo l − 1 the gas constant. This is a compilation of the historic Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Pressure law, which each relate two of the three variables, p , V and T , (for a fixed mass of gas), while keeping the other constant. Quick Q1 What is the pressure of 2 mol of hydrogen in a 4 d m 3 container at 300 K ? Show answer A Level Part D Pressure from kinetic theory Kinetic theory tries to explain the large-scale macroscopic properties of the gas via the microscopic motion of the particles which make up the gas. Thus pressure inside a container is due to the particles colliding with the walls of the container; the momentum change of the particles as they bounce off produces a reaction force on the wall. When a particle strikes a wall, as in the diagram below (in 2D), the component of its velocity perpendicular to the wall is reversed, whereas that parallel to the wall is maintained. Thus the impulse on the wall of the collision below is 2 m v x ​ . Figure 4: Particle colliding with container wall If you consider a rectangular box, as in Figure 5 , the time taken between collisions on a wall is t = v n ​ 2 l n ​ ​ . Here v n ​ is the speed in the direction of l n ​ . As number of collisions in a time T is t T ​ Thus: Total impulse of one particle = I 1 ​ = number of collisions × impulse of each collision = 2 l n ​ T v n ​ ​ × 2 m v n ​ = l n ​ T m v n ​ 2 ​ Figure 5: The rectangular box used in the derivation above. l n ​ can refer to any side lengths: l x ​ , l y ​ or l z ​ .

(Photo by Tomihahndorf) Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Jean-Baptiste Biot collecting air samples at different altitudes. In addition to discovering boron, Gay-Lussac discovered that the composition of the atmosphere does not change with increasing altitude. Discovery of Boron Dr. Doug Stewart Boron compounds such as borax (sodium tetraborate, Na 2 B 4 O 7 ·10H 2 O) were known and used by ancient cultures for thousands of years. Borax’s name comes from the Arabic buraq , meaning “white.” Boron was first partially isolated in 1808 by French chemists Joseph L. Gay-Lussac and L. J. Thénard and independently by Sir Humphry Davy in London. Gay-Lussac & Thénard reacted boric acid with magnesium or sodium to yield boron, a gray solid. (1) They believed it shared characteristics with sulfur and phosphorus and named it bore . (2) Davy first tried to produce boron by electrolysis of boric acid, but was not satisfied with the results. He enjoyed greater success reacting boric acid with potassium in a hydrogen atmosphere. The result was a powdery substance. Davy commented the substance was, “of the darkest shades of olive. It is opake, very friable, and its powder does not scratch glass.” After carrying out a number of chemical reactions to verify the uniqueness of the substance, Davy wrote, “there is strong reason to consider the boracic basis as metallic in nature, and I venture to propose for it the name of boracium .” (2) Neither party had, in fact, produced pure boron. Their samples were only about 60% pure. In 1909, American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub produced 99% pure boron, by reducing boron halides with hydrogen . Almost a century later, in 2004, Jiuhua Chen and Vladimir L. Solozhenko produced a new form of boron, but were uncertain of its structure. In 2009, a team led by Artem Oganov was able to demonstrate the new form of boron contains two structures, B 12 icosohedra and B 2 pairs. (3) Gamma-boron, as it has been called, is almost as hard as diamond and more heat-resistant than diamond. Talking about boron’s part metal, part non-metal properties, Oganov said, “Boron is a truly schizophrenic element. It’s an element of complete frustration. It doesn’t know what it wants to do. The outcome is something horribly complicated.” (4) Interesting Facts about Boron Boron is a tough element – very hard, and very resistant to heat. In its crystalline form it is the second hardest of all the elements on the mohs scale – only carbon (diamond) is harder. Only 11 elements have higher melting points than boron: these are C, W, Re, Os, Ta, Mo, Nb, Ir, Ru, Hf, and Tc. (As a challenge, how many of these elements can you name without looking them up?) Boron is an essential nutrient for all green plants. Boron in its crystalline form is very unreactive. Amorphous boron is reactive. Unusually, the universe’s atoms of boron were not made by nuclear fusion within stars and were not made in the big bang. They were made by nuclear fusion in cosmic-ray collisions. Most of the universe’s boron was made in this way before the formation of our solar system. Boron is an indispensable element in NIB magnets (Neodymium – Iron – Boron). NIB magnets are very powerful magnets invented in the early 1980s. They are used in computers, cell phones, medical equipment, toys, motors, wind turbines and audio systems. Boron is used to control nuclear reactions. It is an excellent neutron absorber. Alloyed with steel or reacted with carbon, titanium or zirconium, it is used in control rods for nuclear reactors. Pure boron can exist as a mixture of positive and negative boron ions. Boron compounds burn with a green flame. The distinctive color leads to use in fireworks. Boron is an ionic element – pure boron can exist as a mixture of positive and negative boron ions. Appearance and Characteristics Harmful effects: Elemental boron is not known to be toxic. Characteristics: Boron is a metalloid, intermediate between metals and non-metals. It exists in many polymorphs (different crystal lattice structures), some more metallic than others. Metallic boron is extremely hard and has a very high melting point. Boron does not generally make ionic bonds, it forms stable covalent bonds. Although opaque to visible light, boron can transmit portions of infrared light. Boron is a poor room temperature conductor of electricity but its conductivity improves markedly at higher temperatures. Uses of Boron Boron is used to dope silicon and germanium semiconductors, modifying their electrical properties. Boron oxide (B 2 O 3 ) is used in glassmaking and ceramics. Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10H 2 O) is used in making fiberglass, as a cleansing fluid, a water softener, insecticide, herbicide and disinfectant. Boric acid (H 3 BO 3 ) is used as a mild antiseptic and as a flame retardant. Boron Nitride’s\thardness is second only to diamond, but it has better thermal and chemical stability, hence boron nitride ceramics are used in high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride nanotubes can have a similar structure to carbon nanotubes. BN nanotubes are more thermally and chemically stable than carbon nanotubes and, unlike carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes are electrical insulators. Boron carbide (B 4 C) is used in tank armor and bullet proof vests.

In addition to discovering boron, Gay-Lussac discovered that the composition of the atmosphere does not change with increasing altitude. Discovery of Boron Dr. Doug Stewart Boron compounds such as borax (sodium tetraborate, Na 2 B 4 O 7 ·10H 2 O) were known and used by ancient cultures for thousands of years. Borax’s name comes from the Arabic buraq , meaning “white.” Boron was first partially isolated in 1808 by French chemists Joseph L. Gay-Lussac and L. J. Thénard and independently by Sir Humphry Davy in London. Gay-Lussac & Thénard reacted boric acid with magnesium or sodium to yield boron, a gray solid. (1) They believed it shared characteristics with sulfur and phosphorus and named it bore . (2) Davy first tried to produce boron by electrolysis of boric acid, but was not satisfied with the results. He enjoyed greater success reacting boric acid with potassium in a hydrogen atmosphere. The result was a powdery substance. Davy commented the substance was, “of the darkest shades of olive. It is opake, very friable, and its powder does not scratch glass.” After carrying out a number of chemical reactions to verify the uniqueness of the substance, Davy wrote, “there is strong reason to consider the boracic basis as metallic in nature, and I venture to propose for it the name of boracium .” (2) Neither party had, in fact, produced pure boron. Their samples were only about 60% pure. In 1909, American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub produced 99% pure boron, by reducing boron halides with hydrogen . Almost a century later, in 2004, Jiuhua Chen and Vladimir L. Solozhenko produced a new form of boron, but were uncertain of its structure. In 2009, a team led by Artem Oganov was able to demonstrate the new form of boron contains two structures, B 12 icosohedra and B 2 pairs. (3) Gamma-boron, as it has been called, is almost as hard as diamond and more heat-resistant than diamond. Talking about boron’s part metal, part non-metal properties, Oganov said, “Boron is a truly schizophrenic element. It’s an element of complete frustration. It doesn’t know what it wants to do. The outcome is something horribly complicated.” (4) Interesting Facts about Boron Boron is a tough element – very hard, and very resistant to heat. In its crystalline form it is the second hardest of all the elements on the mohs scale – only carbon (diamond) is harder. Only 11 elements have higher melting points than boron: these are C, W, Re, Os, Ta, Mo, Nb, Ir, Ru, Hf, and Tc. (As a challenge, how many of these elements can you name without looking them up?) Boron is an essential nutrient for all green plants. Boron in its crystalline form is very unreactive. Amorphous boron is reactive. Unusually, the universe’s atoms of boron were not made by nuclear fusion within stars and were not made in the big bang. They were made by nuclear fusion in cosmic-ray collisions. Most of the universe’s boron was made in this way before the formation of our solar system. Boron is an indispensable element in NIB magnets (Neodymium – Iron – Boron). NIB magnets are very powerful magnets invented in the early 1980s. They are used in computers, cell phones, medical equipment, toys, motors, wind turbines and audio systems. Boron is used to control nuclear reactions. It is an excellent neutron absorber. Alloyed with steel or reacted with carbon, titanium or zirconium, it is used in control rods for nuclear reactors. Pure boron can exist as a mixture of positive and negative boron ions. Boron compounds burn with a green flame. The distinctive color leads to use in fireworks. Boron is an ionic element – pure boron can exist as a mixture of positive and negative boron ions. Appearance and Characteristics Harmful effects: Elemental boron is not known to be toxic. Characteristics: Boron is a metalloid, intermediate between metals and non-metals. It exists in many polymorphs (different crystal lattice structures), some more metallic than others. Metallic boron is extremely hard and has a very high melting point. Boron does not generally make ionic bonds, it forms stable covalent bonds. Although opaque to visible light, boron can transmit portions of infrared light. Boron is a poor room temperature conductor of electricity but its conductivity improves markedly at higher temperatures. Uses of Boron Boron is used to dope silicon and germanium semiconductors, modifying their electrical properties. Boron oxide (B 2 O 3 ) is used in glassmaking and ceramics. Borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10H 2 O) is used in making fiberglass, as a cleansing fluid, a water softener, insecticide, herbicide and disinfectant. Boric acid (H 3 BO 3 ) is used as a mild antiseptic and as a flame retardant. Boron Nitride’s\thardness is second only to diamond, but it has better thermal and chemical stability, hence boron nitride ceramics are used in high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride nanotubes can have a similar structure to carbon nanotubes. BN nanotubes are more thermally and chemically stable than carbon nanotubes and, unlike carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes are electrical insulators. Boron carbide (B 4 C) is used in tank armor and bullet proof vests.

    "html": "PhysicsLAB: A Derivation of Snell's Law Resource Lesson A Derivation of Snell's Law Printer Friendly Version In this lesson we are going to look at a derivation of Snell's Law based on the Principle of Least Time. In the diagram shown above, two mediums are juxtapositioned one below the other. A ray of light beginning in the top medium travels through the interface into the bottom medium. When the ray enters the second medium (which we are assuming in the more optically dense medium) its speed will be reduced. Therefore the angle at which it enters the second medium is smaller than the angle from which it left the first medium. Note that the angles are measured between the rays and the normal, NOT between the rays and the interface (aka, surface). To determine the best path of these two rays whose starting and ending positions are fixed we are going to allow the value of x, or the distance the ray travels in the top medium, the ability to vary. That is, the ray may enter the bottom medium at any point along the interface. To generalize our calculation, we are going to set up defined quantities based on the two shaded right triangles below. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that ( Equations 1 ) Since light travels at a constant speed in each medium, we also know that ( Equations 2 ) The total time that the light ray requires to travel between its predetermined starting and ending points can now be written as  ( Equation 3 ) In calculus to minimize or maximize a quantity, we takes its derivative and set it equal to zero.

    "html1": "PhysicsLAB: A Derivation of Snell's Law Resource Lesson A Derivation of Snell's Law Printer Friendly Version In this lesson we are going to look at a derivation of Snell's Law based on the Principle of Least Time. In the diagram shown above, two mediums are juxtapositioned one below the other. A ray of light beginning in the top medium travels through the interface into the bottom medium. When the ray enters the second medium (which we are assuming in the more optically dense medium) its speed will be reduced. Therefore the angle at which it enters the second medium is smaller than the angle from which it left the first medium. Note that the angles are measured between the rays and the normal, NOT between the rays and the interface (aka, surface). To determine the best path of these two rays whose starting and ending positions are fixed we are going to allow the value of x, or the distance the ray travels in the top medium, the ability to vary. That is, the ray may enter the bottom medium at any point along the interface. To generalize our calculation, we are going to set up defined quantities based on the two shaded right triangles below. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that ( Equations 1 ) Since light travels at a constant speed in each medium, we also know that ( Equations 2 ) The total time that the light ray requires to travel between its predetermined starting and ending points can now be written as  ( Equation 3 ) In calculus to minimize or maximize a quantity, we takes its derivative and set it equal to zero. ( Equations 4 ) Simplifying the derivative gives us, ( Equations 5 ) From our original diagram of the two shaded right triangles, notice that ( Equations 6 ) giving us ( Equation 7 ) Now, our final step involves remembering the definition of the index of refraction, ( Equation 8 ) Substituting out terms in our equation gives us the familiar expression for Snell's Law.

HERITAGE IMAGE PARTNERSHIP LTD/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pocket Reddit Print By Tom Siegfried January 8, 2019 at 12:29 pm Every field of science has its favorite anniversary. For physics, it’s Newton’s Principia of 1687, the book that introduced the laws of motion and gravity. Biology celebrates Darwin’s On the Origin of Species (1859) along with his birthday (1809). Astronomy fans commemorate 1543, when Copernicus placed the sun at the center of the solar system. And for chemistry, no cause for celebration surpasses the origin of the periodic table of the elements, created 150 years ago this March by the Russian chemist Dmitrii Ivanovich Mendeleev. Mendeleev’s table has become as familiar to chemistry students as spreadsheets are to accountants. It summarizes an entire science in 100 or so squares containing symbols and numbers. It enumerates the elements that compose all earthly substances, arranged so as to reveal patterns in their properties, guiding the pursuit of chemical research both in theory and in practice. “The periodic table,” wrote the chemist Peter Atkins, “is arguably the most important concept in chemistry.” Mendeleev’s table looked like an ad hoc chart, but he intended the table to express a deep scientific truth he had uncovered: the periodic law. His law revealed profound familial relationships among the known chemical elements — they exhibited similar properties at regular intervals (or periods) when arranged in order of their atomic weights — and enabled Mendeleev to predict the existence of elements that had not yet been discovered. “Before the promulgation of this law the chemical elements were mere fragmentary, incidental facts in Nature,” Mendeleev declared. “The law of periodicity first enabled us to perceive undiscovered elements at a distance which formerly was inaccessible to chemical vision.” Mendeleev’s table did more than foretell the existence of new elements. It validated the then-controversial belief in the reality of atoms. It hinted at the existence of subatomic structure and anticipated the mathematical apparatus underlying the rules governing matter that eventually revealed itself in quantum theory. His table finished the transformation of chemical science from the medieval magical mysticism of alchemy to the realm of modern scientific rigor. The periodic table symbolizes not merely the constituents of matter, but the logical cogency and principled rationality of all science. An ordered vision Mendeleev’s periodic table, published in 1869, was a vertical chart that organized 63 known elements by atomic weight. This arrangement placed elements with similar properties into horizontal rows. The title, translated from Russian, reads: “Draft of system of elements: based on their atomic masses and chemical characteristics.” Historic Images/Alamy Stock Photo Laying the groundwork Legend has it that Mendeleev conceived and created his table in a single day: February 17, 1869, on the Russian calendar (March 1 in most of the rest of the world). But that’s probably an exaggeration. Mendeleev had been thinking about grouping the elements for years, and other chemists had considered the notion of relationships among the elements several times in the preceding decades. In fact, German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner noticed peculiarities in groupings of elements as early as 1817. In those days, chemists hadn’t yet fully grasped the nature of atoms, as described in the atomic theory proposed by English schoolteacher John Dalton in 1808. In his New System of Chemical Philosophy , Dalton explained chemical reactions by assuming that each elementary substance was made of a particular type of atom. Chemical reactions, Dalton proposed, produced new substances when atoms were disconnected or joined. Any given element consisted entirely of one kind of atom, he reasoned, distinguished from other kinds by weight. Oxygen atoms weighed eight times as much as hydrogen atoms; carbon atoms were six times as heavy as hydrogen, Dalton believed. When elements combined to make new substances, the amounts that reacted could be calculated with knowledge of those atomic weights. Dalton was wrong about some of the weights — oxygen is really 16 times the weight of hydrogen, and carbon is 12 times heavier than hydrogen. But his theory made the idea of atoms useful, inspiring a revolution in chemistry. Measuring atomic weights accurately became a prime preoccupation for chemists in the decades that followed. When contemplating those weights, Döbereiner noted that certain sets of three elements (he called them triads) showed a peculiar relationship. Bromine, for example, had an atomic weight midway between the weights of chlorine and iodine, and all three elements exhibited similar chemical behavior. Lithium, sodium and potassium were also a triad. Intrinsic order Every element on this venerated table has its own story. All together, they capture the entire repertoire of known chemistry. Read up on the tales between the lines . E. Otwell Other chemists perceived links between atomic weights and chemical properties, but it was not until the 1860s that atomic weights had been well enough understood and measured for deeper insights to emerge. In England, the chemist John Newlands noticed that arranging the known elements in order of increasing atomic weight produced a recurrence of chemical properties every eighth element, a pattern he called the “law of octaves” in an 1865 paper. But Newlands’ pattern did not hold up very well after the first couple of octaves, leading a critic to suggest that he should try arranging the elements in alphabetical order instead. Clearly, the relationship of element properties and atomic weights was a bit more complicated, as Mendeleev soon realized. Organizing the elements Born in Tobolsk, in Siberia, in 1834 (his parents’ 17th child), Mendeleev lived a dispersed life, pursuing multiple interests and traveling a higgledy-piggledy path to prominence. During his higher education at a teaching institute in St. Petersburg, he nearly died from a serious illness. After graduation, he taught at middle schools (a requirement of his scholarship at the teaching institute), and while teaching math and science, he conducted research for his master’s degree. He then worked as a tutor and lecturer (along with some popular science writing on the side) until earning a fellowship for an extended tour of research at Europe’s most prominent university chemistry laboratories. When he returned to St. Petersburg, he had no job, so he wrote a masterful handbook on organic chemistry in hopes of winning a large cash prize. It was a long shot that paid off, with the lucrative Demidov Prize in 1862. He also found work as an editor, translator and consultant to various chemical industries. Eventually he returned to research, earning his Ph.D. in 1865 and then becoming a professor at the University of St. Petersburg. Soon thereafter, Mendeleev found himself about to teach inorganic chemistry. In preparing to master that new (to him) field, he was unimpressed by the available textbooks. So he decided to write his own. Organizing the text required organizing the elements, so the question of how best to arrange them was on his mind. By early 1869, Mendeleev had made enough progress to realize that some groups of similar elements showed a regular increase in atomic weights; other elements with roughly equal atomic weights shared common properties. It appeared that ordering the elements by their atomic weight was the key to categorizing them. By Mendeleev’s own account, he structured his thinking by writing each of the 63 known elements’ properties on an individual note card. Then, by way of a sort of game of chemical solitaire, he found the pattern he was seeking. Arranging the cards in vertical columns from lower to higher atomic weights placed elements with similar properties in each horizontal row. Mendeleev’s periodic table was born. He sketched out his table on March 1, sent it to the printer and incorporated it into his soon-to-be-published textbook. He quickly prepared a paper to be presented to the Russian Chemical Society. Sketchy A handwritten draft of Mendeleev’s periodic table, in which he organized the elements by atomic weight to reveal the periodic law, showing how elements had similar properties at regular intervals, or periodicities. INTERFOTO/Alamy Stock Photo “Elements arranged according to the size of their atomic weights show clear periodic properties,” Mendeleev declared in his paper. “All the comparisons which I have made … lead me to conclude that the size of the atomic weight determines the nature of the elements.” Meanwhile, the German chemist Lothar Meyer had also been working on organizing the elements. He prepared a table similar to Mendeleev’s, perhaps even before Mendeleev did. But Mendeleev published first. More important than beating Meyer to the publication punch, though, was Mendeleev’s use of his table to make bold predictions about undiscovered elements. In preparing his table, Mendeleev had noticed that some note cards were missing. He had to leave blank spaces to get the known elements to properly align. Within his lifetime, three of those blanks were filled with the previously unknown elements gallium, scandium and germanium. Not only had Mendeleev predicted the existence of these elements, but he had also correctly described their properties in detail. Gallium, for instance, discovered in 1875, had an atomic weight (as measured then) of 69.9 and a density six times that of water. Mendeleev had predicted an element (he called it eka-aluminum) with just that density and an atomic weight of 68. His predictions for eka-silicon closely matched germanium (discovered in 1886) in atomic weight (72 predicted, 72.3 observed) and density (5.5 versus 5.469). He also correctly predicted the density of germanium’s compounds with oxygen and chlorine. Mendeleev’s table had become an oracle. It was as if end-of-game Scrabble tiles spelled out the secrets of the universe. While others had glimpsed the periodic law’s power, Mendeleev was the master at exploiting it. Mendeleev’s successful predictions earned him legendary status as a maestro of chemical wizardry. But today, historians dispute whether the discovery of the predicted elements cemented the acceptance of his periodic law. The law’s approval may have been more due to its power to explain established chemical relationships. In any case, Mendeleev’s prognosticative accuracy certainly attracted attention to the merits of his table. Elements arranged according to the size of their atomic weights show clear periodic properties. — Dmitrii Mendeleev, 1869 By the 1890s, chemists widely recognized his law as a landmark in chemical knowledge. In 1900, the future Nobel chemistry laureate William Ramsay called it “the greatest generalization which has as yet been made in chemistry.” And Mendeleev had done it without understanding in any deep way why it worked at all. A mathematical map In many instances in the history of science, grand predictions based on novel equations have turned out to be correct. Somehow math reveals some of nature’s secrets before experimenters find them. Antimatter is one example, the expansion of the universe another. In Mendeleev’s case, the predictions of new elements emerged without any creative mathematics. But in fact, Mendeleev had discovered a deep mathematical map of nature, for his table reflected the implications of quantum mechanics, the mathematical rules governing atomic architecture. In his textbook, Mendeleev had noted that “internal differences of the matter that comprises the atoms” could be responsible for the elements’ periodically recurring properties. But he did not pursue that line of thought. In fact, over the years he waffled about how important atomic theory was for his table. But others could read the table’s message. In 1888, German chemist Johannes Wislicenus declared that the periodicity of the elements’ properties when arranged by weight indicated that atoms are composed of regular arrangements of smaller particles. So in a sense, Mendeleev’s table did anticipate (and provide evidence for) the complex internal structure of atoms, at a time when nobody had any idea what an atom really looked like, or even whether it had any internal structure at all. By the time of Mendeleev’s death in 1907, scientists knew that atoms had parts: electrons, which carried a negative electric charge, plus some positively charged component to make atoms electrically neutral. A key clue to how those parts were arranged came in 1911, when the physicist Ernest Rutherford, working at the University of Manchester in England, discovered the atomic nucleus. Shortly thereafter Henry Moseley, a physicist who had worked with Rutherford, demonstrated that the amount of positive charge in the nucleus (the number of protons it contained, or its “atomic number”) determined the correct order of the elements in the periodic table. Atomic weight was closely related to Moseley’s atomic number — close enough that ordering elements by weight differs in only a few spots from ordering by number. Mendeleev had insisted that those weights were wrong and needed to be remeasured, and in some cases he was right. A few discrepancies remained, but Moseley’s atomic number set the table straight. At about the same time, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr realized that quantum theory governed the arrangement of electrons surrounding the nucleus and that the outermost electrons determined an element’s chemical properties. Physicist Niels Bohr revised the periodic table in 1922. QWerk/Wikimedia Commons Similar arrangements of the outer electrons would recur periodically, explaining the patterns that Mendeleev’s table had originally revealed. Bohr created his own version of the table in 1922, based on experimental measurements of electron energies (along with some guidance from the periodic law). Bohr’s table added elements discovered since 1869, but it was still, in essence, the periodic arrangement that Mendeleev had discovered. Without the slightest clue to quantum theory, Mendeleev had created a table reflecting the atomic architecture that quantum physics dictated. Derivative In Danish physicist Niels Bohr’s 1922 version of the periodic table, adapted from a table by Danish chemist Julius Thomsen, elements with similar properties occupy horizontal rows connected by lines. The empty box on the right marks the expected occurrence of a group of elements that are chemically similar to the rare earth elements (numbers 58–70) in the preceding column. N. Bohr, 1922 Bohr’s new table was neither the first nor last variant on Mendeleev’s original design. Hundreds of versions of the periodic table have been devised and published. The modern form, a horizontal design in contrast with Mendeleev’s original vertical version, became widely popular only after World War II, largely due to the work of the American chemist Glenn Seaborg (a longtime member of the board of Science Service, the original publisher of Science News ). Seaborg and collaborators had synthetically produced several new elements with atomic numbers beyond uranium, the last naturally occurring element in the table. Seaborg saw that these elements, the transuranics (plus the three elements preceding uranium) demanded a new row in the table, something Mendeleev had not foreseen. Seaborg’s table added the row for those elements beneath a similar row for the rare earth elements, whose proper place had never been quite clear, either. “It took a lot of guts to buck Mendeleev,” Seaborg, who died in 1999, said in a 1997 interview. Seaborg’s contributions to chemistry earned him the honor of his own namesake element, seaborgium, number 106. It’s one of a handful of elements named to honor a famous scientist, a list that includes, of course, element 101, discovered by Seaborg and colleagues in 1955 and named mendelevium — for the chemist who above all others deserved a place at the periodic table. In his revision, American chemist Glenn Seaborg turned the periodic table horizontal, adding several synthetically produced elements beyond uranium.

He also correctly predicted the density of germanium’s compounds with oxygen and chlorine. Mendeleev’s table had become an oracle. It was as if end-of-game Scrabble tiles spelled out the secrets of the universe. While others had glimpsed the periodic law’s power, Mendeleev was the master at exploiting it. Mendeleev’s successful predictions earned him legendary status as a maestro of chemical wizardry. But today, historians dispute whether the discovery of the predicted elements cemented the acceptance of his periodic law. The law’s approval may have been more due to its power to explain established chemical relationships. In any case, Mendeleev’s prognosticative accuracy certainly attracted attention to the merits of his table. Elements arranged according to the size of their atomic weights show clear periodic properties. — Dmitrii Mendeleev, 1869 By the 1890s, chemists widely recognized his law as a landmark in chemical knowledge. In 1900, the future Nobel chemistry laureate William Ramsay called it “the greatest generalization which has as yet been made in chemistry.” And Mendeleev had done it without understanding in any deep way why it worked at all. A mathematical map In many instances in the history of science, grand predictions based on novel equations have turned out to be correct. Somehow math reveals some of nature’s secrets before experimenters find them. Antimatter is one example, the expansion of the universe another. In Mendeleev’s case, the predictions of new elements emerged without any creative mathematics. But in fact, Mendeleev had discovered a deep mathematical map of nature, for his table reflected the implications of quantum mechanics, the mathematical rules governing atomic architecture. In his textbook, Mendeleev had noted that “internal differences of the matter that comprises the atoms” could be responsible for the elements’ periodically recurring properties. But he did not pursue that line of thought. In fact, over the years he waffled about how important atomic theory was for his table. But others could read the table’s message. In 1888, German chemist Johannes Wislicenus declared that the periodicity of the elements’ properties when arranged by weight indicated that atoms are composed of regular arrangements of smaller particles. So in a sense, Mendeleev’s table did anticipate (and provide evidence for) the complex internal structure of atoms, at a time when nobody had any idea what an atom really looked like, or even whether it had any internal structure at all. By the time of Mendeleev’s death in 1907, scientists knew that atoms had parts: electrons, which carried a negative electric charge, plus some positively charged component to make atoms electrically neutral. A key clue to how those parts were arranged came in 1911, when the physicist Ernest Rutherford, working at the University of Manchester in England, discovered the atomic nucleus. Shortly thereafter Henry Moseley, a physicist who had worked with Rutherford, demonstrated that the amount of positive charge in the nucleus (the number of protons it contained, or its “atomic number”) determined the correct order of the elements in the periodic table. Atomic weight was closely related to Moseley’s atomic number — close enough that ordering elements by weight differs in only a few spots from ordering by number. Mendeleev had insisted that those weights were wrong and needed to be remeasured, and in some cases he was right. A few discrepancies remained, but Moseley’s atomic number set the table straight. At about the same time, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr realized that quantum theory governed the arrangement of electrons surrounding the nucleus and that the outermost electrons determined an element’s chemical properties. Physicist Niels Bohr revised the periodic table in 1922. QWerk/Wikimedia Commons Similar arrangements of the outer electrons would recur periodically, explaining the patterns that Mendeleev’s table had originally revealed. Bohr created his own version of the table in 1922, based on experimental measurements of electron energies (along with some guidance from the periodic law). Bohr’s table added elements discovered since 1869, but it was still, in essence, the periodic arrangement that Mendeleev had discovered. Without the slightest clue to quantum theory, Mendeleev had created a table reflecting the atomic architecture that quantum physics dictated. Derivative In Danish physicist Niels Bohr’s 1922 version of the periodic table, adapted from a table by Danish chemist Julius Thomsen, elements with similar properties occupy horizontal rows connected by lines. The empty box on the right marks the expected occurrence of a group of elements that are chemically similar to the rare earth elements (numbers 58–70) in the preceding column. N. Bohr, 1922 Bohr’s new table was neither the first nor last variant on Mendeleev’s original design. Hundreds of versions of the periodic table have been devised and published. The modern form, a horizontal design in contrast with Mendeleev’s original vertical version, became widely popular only after World War II, largely due to the work of the American chemist Glenn Seaborg (a longtime member of the board of Science Service, the original publisher of Science News ). Seaborg and collaborators had synthetically produced several new elements with atomic numbers beyond uranium, the last naturally occurring element in the table. Seaborg saw that these elements, the transuranics (plus the three elements preceding uranium) demanded a new row in the table, something Mendeleev had not foreseen. Seaborg’s table added the row for those elements beneath a similar row for the rare earth elements, whose proper place had never been quite clear, either. “It took a lot of guts to buck Mendeleev,” Seaborg, who died in 1999, said in a 1997 interview. Seaborg’s contributions to chemistry earned him the honor of his own namesake element, seaborgium, number 106. It’s one of a handful of elements named to honor a famous scientist, a list that includes, of course, element 101, discovered by Seaborg and colleagues in 1955 and named mendelevium — for the chemist who above all others deserved a place at the periodic table. In his revision, American chemist Glenn Seaborg turned the periodic table horizontal, adding several synthetically produced elements beyond uranium.

(Courtesy: Shutterstock/meunierd) The US administration is carrying out “a wholesale assault on US science” that could hold back research in the country for several decades. That is the warning from more than 1900 members of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine , who have signed an open letter condemning the policies introduced by Donald Trump since he took up office on 20 January . US universities are in the firing line of the Trump administration, which is seeking to revoke the visas of foreign students, threatening to withdraw grants and demanding control over academic syllabuses. “The voice of science must not be silenced,” the letter writers say. “We all benefit from science, and we all stand to lose if the nation’s research enterprise is destroyed.” Particularly hard hit are the country’s eight Ivy League universities, which have been accused of downplaying antisemitism exhibited in campus demonstrations in support of Gaza. Columbia University in New York, for example, has been trying to regain $400m in federal funds that the Trump administration threatened to cancel. Columbia initially reached an agreement with the government on issues such as banning facemasks on its campus and taking control of its department responsible for courses on the Middle East. But on 8 April, according to reports , the National Institutes of Health, under orders from the Department of Health and Human Services, blocked all of its grants to Columbia. Harvard University, meanwhile, has announced plans to privately borrow $750m after the Trump administration announced that it would review $9bn in the university’s government funding. Brown University in Rhode Island faces a loss of $510m, while the government has suspended several dozen research grants for Princeton University. The administration also continues to oppose the use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in universities. The University of Pennsylvania, from which Donald Trump graduated, faces the suspension of $175m in grants for offences against the government’s DEI policy. Brain drain Researchers in medical and social sciences are bearing the brunt of government cuts, with physics departments seeing relatively little impact on staffing and recruitment so far. “Of course we are concerned,” Peter Littlewoo d, chair of the University of Chicago’s physics department, told Physics World . “Nonetheless, we have made a deliberate decision not to halt faculty recruiting and stand by all our PhD offers.” David Hsieh , executive officer for physics at California Institute of Technology, told Physics World that his department has also not taken any action so far. “I am sure that each institution is preparing in ways that make the most sense for them,” he says. “But I am not aware of any collective response at the moment.” Read more US science rues ongoing demotion of research under President Trump Yet universities are already bracing themselves for a potential brain drain. “The faculty and postdoc market is international, and the current sentiment makes the US less attractive for reasons beyond just finance,” warns Littlewood at Chicago. That sentiment is echoed by Maura Healey , governor of Massachusetts, who claims that Europe, the Middle East and China are already recruiting the state’s best and brightest. “[They’re saying] we’ll give you a lab; we’ll give you staff.

    "html": "Lesson 51: Closed & Open Ended Pipes Lesson 51: Closed & Open Ended Pipes Many musical instruments depend on the musician in some way moving air through the instrument. This includes brass and woodwind instruments, as well as instruments like pipe organs. All instruments like this can be divided into two categories, open ended or closed ended . A “pipe” can be any tube, even if it has been bent into different shapes or has holes cut into it. An open ended instrument has both ends open to the air. An example would be an instrument like a trumpet. You blow in through one end and the sound comes out the other end of the pipe. The keys on the trumpet allow the air to move through the \"pipe\" in different ways so that different notes can be played. A closed ended instrument has one end closed off, and the other end open. An example would be an instrument like some organ pipes (although in some designs they are open), or a flute. Although you blow in through the mouth piece of a flute, the opening you’re blowing into isn’t at the end of the pipe, it’s along the side of the flute. The end of the pipe is closed off near the mouth piece. The frequencies of sounds made by these two types of instruments are different because of the different ways that air will move at a closed or open end of the pipe. The diagrams that I will be drawing are based on the way the air will move as a wave. Although the sound waves actually travel through the pipes as longitudinal waves, I will be drawing transverse waves. This is just because they are easier to draw and recognize in the diagrams. Identifying Fractions of Wavelengths Before we look at the diagrams of the pipes, let’s make sure that you know what fractions of a wave look like. This will be important in the way you interpret the diagrams later. Figure 1: One Wavelength Figure 2: Three Quarters (¾) of a Wavelength Figure 3: One Half (½) of a Wavelength Figure 4: One Quarter (¼) of a Wavelength These wave fractions might appear upside down, flipped over, turned around, etc., but they will still represent portions of a wave. When we are talking about the sounds that pipes can make, what we are really concerned with is how much of the wave we can fit into the pipe. Different amounts of a wavelength in a pipe will result in a different frequency being heard. Because these are the frequencies of the waves that will naturally resonate in the pipes, we call them the resonant frequencies . In music, you might have heard these referred to as harmonics . Although the actual length of the pipe remains the same, different notes are played. If you have ever played a wind instrument, you know that with the same keys pressed you can play different notes by controlling how you blow into the instrument… the difference between let’s say a low C and a high C note. The lowest note you can play (which is also the smallest part of the wave that can fit inside the pipe) is usually called the fundamental . Fitting in more of the wave produces different notes, different harmonics . Closed Ended Pipes Figure 5: The Fundamental Remember that it is actually air that is doing the vibrating as a wave here. The air at the closed end of the pipe must be a node (not moving), since the air is not free to move there and must be able to be reflected back. There must also be an antinode where the opening is, since that is where there is maximum movement of the air. The simplest, smallest wave that I can possibly fit in a closed end pipe is shown in Figure 5 . Notice how even though it has been flipped left-to-right and it looks squished and stretched a bit to fit, this is still ¼ of a wavelength. Since this is the smallest stable piece of a wave I can fit in this pipe, this is the Fundamental , or 1 st Harmonic . Since the length of the tube is the same as the length of the ¼ wavelength I know that the length of this tube is ¼ of a wavelength… this leads to our first formula: L = ¼ λ “L” is the length of the tube in metres. On it’s own this formula really doesn’t help us much. Instead, we have to solve this formula for λ and then combine it with the formula v=fλ to get a more useful formula: f = frequency of sound (Hz) v = velocity of sound in air (m/s) L = length of tube (m) Figure 6: Fundamental with Reflection When the wave reaches the closed end it’s going to be reflected as an inverted wave (going from air to whatever the pipe is made of is a pretty big change so this is what we would expect. It would look like Figure 6 . This does not change the length of the wave in our formula, since we are only seeing the reflection of the wave that already exists in the pipe. What does the next harmonic look like? It’s the 3 rd Harmonic . I know this name might seem a little confusing (I’m the first to agree with you!) but because of the actual notes produced and the way the waves fit in, musicians refer to the next step up in a closed end pipe instrument as the 3 rd harmonic … there is no such thing as a 2 nd harmonic for closed end pipes. In fact, all of the harmonics in closed end pipes are going to be odd numbers. Figure 7: Third Harmonic Remember that we have to have an antinode at the opening (where the air is moving) and a node at the closed end (where the air can’t move). That means for the 3 rd harmonic we get something like Figure 7 . This is ¾ of a wavelength fit into the tube, so the length of the tube is… L = ¾ λ This is the third harmonic of the closed end pipe . The formula for the frequency of the note we will hear is… Do you notice a pattern forming in the formulas? Hopefully, because for both open and closed end pipes, we will only give you the formulas for the fundamentals lengths. You need to remember how to get the rest. If we drew in the reflection of the third harmonic it would look like Figure 8 . Figure 8: Third Harmonic with Reflection Figure 9: The Fifth Harmonic One more to make sure you see the pattern. The 5 th Harmonic ( Figure 9 ). There is one full wavelength in there (4/4) plus an extra ¼ of a wavelength for a total of 5/4. The length of the pipe is… L = 5/4 λ And the note produced by the 5 th Harmonic is found using the formula… Figure 10 shows the reflection of a 5 th Harmonic for a closed end pipe. Figure 10: The Fifth Harmonic with Reflection Open End Pipes I know you’re probably thinking that there couldn’t possibly be any more stuff to learn about this, but we still have to do open end pipes. Thankfully, they’re not that hard, and if you got the basics for closed pipes it should go pretty fast for you. Figure 11: Fundamental The fundamental ( first harmonic ) for an open end pipe needs to be an antinode at both ends, since the air can move at both ends. That’s why the smallest wave we can fit in is shown in Figure 11 . This looks different than the ½ wavelength that I showed you in Figure 3 , but it is still half of a full wavelength. That means the length of the tube and frequency formula are… L = ½ λ The whole thing after it reflects at the other end looks like Figure 12 . Figure 12: Fundamental with Reflection Figure 13: 2 nd Harmonic The next note we can play is the 2 nd harmonic . Yep, open end pipes have a 2 nd harmonic … they can have any number harmonic they want, odd or even. Again, it kind of looks weird, but trace it out and you’ll see that there is exactly one wavelength here. The length and frequency formulas are… L = 2/2 λ Figure 14: 2 nd Harmonic with Reflection I’m not going to show you what the 3 rd harmonic looks like. Instead, try drawing it yourself and see what you get. As a hint to help you, the formulas for the length and frequency are… L = 3/2 λ Example 1 : An open ended organ pipe is 3.6m long. a) What is the wavelength of the fundamental played by this pipe? b) What is the frequency of this note if the speed of sound is 346m/s? ( Calculate it using the formulas you’ve just learned, although if you wanted you could use v = f λ ) c) What note could be played as the third harmonic on that pipe? d) If we made the pipe longer, what would happen to the fundamental note… would it be higher or lower frequency? a) L = ½ λ λ = 2L λ = 2(3.6m) λ = 7.2 m b) c) Notice that the third harmonic is three times bigger than the first harmonic . d) If we made the pipe longer, the wavelength would be bigger (just look at the formula in part \"a\" of this example), and since wavelength and frequency are inversely related, that means the frequency would be smaller.",

    "html1": "Lesson 51: Closed & Open Ended Pipes Lesson 51: Closed & Open Ended Pipes Many musical instruments depend on the musician in some way moving air through the instrument. This includes brass and woodwind instruments, as well as instruments like pipe organs. All instruments like this can be divided into two categories, open ended or closed ended . A “pipe” can be any tube, even if it has been bent into different shapes or has holes cut into it. An open ended instrument has both ends open to the air. An example would be an instrument like a trumpet. You blow in through one end and the sound comes out the other end of the pipe. The keys on the trumpet allow the air to move through the \"pipe\" in different ways so that different notes can be played. A closed ended instrument has one end closed off, and the other end open. An example would be an instrument like some organ pipes (although in some designs they are open), or a flute. Although you blow in through the mouth piece of a flute, the opening you’re blowing into isn’t at the end of the pipe, it’s along the side of the flute. The end of the pipe is closed off near the mouth piece. The frequencies of sounds made by these two types of instruments are different because of the different ways that air will move at a closed or open end of the pipe. The diagrams that I will be drawing are based on the way the air will move as a wave. Although the sound waves actually travel through the pipes as longitudinal waves, I will be drawing transverse waves. This is just because they are easier to draw and recognize in the diagrams. Identifying Fractions of Wavelengths Before we look at the diagrams of the pipes, let’s make sure that you know what fractions of a wave look like. This will be important in the way you interpret the diagrams later. Figure 1: One Wavelength Figure 2: Three Quarters (¾) of a Wavelength Figure 3: One Half (½) of a Wavelength Figure 4: One Quarter (¼) of a Wavelength These wave fractions might appear upside down, flipped over, turned around, etc., but they will still represent portions of a wave. When we are talking about the sounds that pipes can make, what we are really concerned with is how much of the wave we can fit into the pipe. Different amounts of a wavelength in a pipe will result in a different frequency being heard. Because these are the frequencies of the waves that will naturally resonate in the pipes, we call them the resonant frequencies . In music, you might have heard these referred to as harmonics . Although the actual length of the pipe remains the same, different notes are played. If you have ever played a wind instrument, you know that with the same keys pressed you can play different notes by controlling how you blow into the instrument… the difference between let’s say a low C and a high C note. The lowest note you can play (which is also the smallest part of the wave that can fit inside the pipe) is usually called the fundamental . Fitting in more of the wave produces different notes, different harmonics . Closed Ended Pipes Figure 5: The Fundamental Remember that it is actually air that is doing the vibrating as a wave here. The air at the closed end of the pipe must be a node (not moving), since the air is not free to move there and must be able to be reflected back. There must also be an antinode where the opening is, since that is where there is maximum movement of the air. The simplest, smallest wave that I can possibly fit in a closed end pipe is shown in Figure 5 . Notice how even though it has been flipped left-to-right and it looks squished and stretched a bit to fit, this is still ¼ of a wavelength. Since this is the smallest stable piece of a wave I can fit in this pipe, this is the Fundamental , or 1 st Harmonic . Since the length of the tube is the same as the length of the ¼ wavelength I know that the length of this tube is ¼ of a wavelength… this leads to our first formula: L = ¼ λ “L” is the length of the tube in metres. On it’s own this formula really doesn’t help us much. Instead, we have to solve this formula for λ and then combine it with the formula v=fλ to get a more useful formula: f = frequency of sound (Hz) v = velocity of sound in air (m/s) L = length of tube (m) Figure 6: Fundamental with Reflection When the wave reaches the closed end it’s going to be reflected as an inverted wave (going from air to whatever the pipe is made of is a pretty big change so this is what we would expect. It would look like Figure 6 . This does not change the length of the wave in our formula, since we are only seeing the reflection of the wave that already exists in the pipe. What does the next harmonic look like? It’s the 3 rd Harmonic . I know this name might seem a little confusing (I’m the first to agree with you!) but because of the actual notes produced and the way the waves fit in, musicians refer to the next step up in a closed end pipe instrument as the 3 rd harmonic … there is no such thing as a 2 nd harmonic for closed end pipes. In fact, all of the harmonics in closed end pipes are going to be odd numbers. Figure 7: Third Harmonic Remember that we have to have an antinode at the opening (where the air is moving) and a node at the closed end (where the air can’t move). That means for the 3 rd harmonic we get something like Figure 7 . This is ¾ of a wavelength fit into the tube, so the length of the tube is… L = ¾ λ This is the third harmonic of the closed end pipe . The formula for the frequency of the note we will hear is… Do you notice a pattern forming in the formulas? Hopefully, because for both open and closed end pipes, we will only give you the formulas for the fundamentals lengths. You need to remember how to get the rest. If we drew in the reflection of the third harmonic it would look like Figure 8 . Figure 8: Third Harmonic with Reflection Figure 9: The Fifth Harmonic One more to make sure you see the pattern. The 5 th Harmonic ( Figure 9 ). There is one full wavelength in there (4/4) plus an extra ¼ of a wavelength for a total of 5/4. The length of the pipe is… L = 5/4 λ And the note produced by the 5 th Harmonic is found using the formula… Figure 10 shows the reflection of a 5 th Harmonic for a closed end pipe. Figure 10: The Fifth Harmonic with Reflection Open End Pipes I know you’re probably thinking that there couldn’t possibly be any more stuff to learn about this, but we still have to do open end pipes. Thankfully, they’re not that hard, and if you got the basics for closed pipes it should go pretty fast for you. Figure 11: Fundamental The fundamental ( first harmonic ) for an open end pipe needs to be an antinode at both ends, since the air can move at both ends. That’s why the smallest wave we can fit in is shown in Figure 11 . This looks different than the ½ wavelength that I showed you in Figure 3 , but it is still half of a full wavelength. That means the length of the tube and frequency formula are… L = ½ λ The whole thing after it reflects at the other end looks like Figure 12 . Figure 12: Fundamental with Reflection Figure 13: 2 nd Harmonic The next note we can play is the 2 nd harmonic . Yep, open end pipes have a 2 nd harmonic … they can have any number harmonic they want, odd or even. Again, it kind of looks weird, but trace it out and you’ll see that there is exactly one wavelength here. The length and frequency formulas are… L = 2/2 λ Figure 14: 2 nd Harmonic with Reflection I’m not going to show you what the 3 rd harmonic looks like. Instead, try drawing it yourself and see what you get. As a hint to help you, the formulas for the length and frequency are… L = 3/2 λ Example 1 : An open ended organ pipe is 3.6m long. a) What is the wavelength of the fundamental played by this pipe? b) What is the frequency of this note if the speed of sound is 346m/s? ( Calculate it using the formulas you’ve just learned, although if you wanted you could use v = f λ ) c) What note could be played as the third harmonic on that pipe? d) If we made the pipe longer, what would happen to the fundamental note… would it be higher or lower frequency? a) L = ½ λ λ = 2L λ = 2(3.6m) λ = 7.2 m b) c) Notice that the third harmonic is three times bigger than the first harmonic . d) If we made the pipe longer, the wavelength would be bigger (just look at the formula in part \"a\" of this example), and since wavelength and frequency are inversely related, that means the frequency would be smaller."

The odd spot of drizzle locally. Chilly in the west under prolonged clear skies. Minimum temperature 5 °C. Sunday: Dry with plenty of warm sunshine after a rather cloudy and cool start. Temperatures above average, but cooler near the coast. Low cloud spreading back inland overnight. Maximum temperature 22 °C. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Mainly fine, with warm sunshine after some cloudy and cool starts, although a risk of isolated showers from Monday. Temperatures above average, but cooler and breezier near some coasts. Updated: 05:00 (UTC+1) on Sat 17 May 2025 UK long range weather forecast Wednesday 21 May - Friday 30 May A generally dry and fine end to the working week with light winds and warm sunshine continuing across the United Kingdom. A few showers are possible, but the majority of places will be dry. Temperatures during this time are likely to continue to be above normal for the time of year. Into the bank holiday weekend and following week, a change in weather type is expected. More unsettled conditions are likely to develop, with weather systems moving in from the Atlantic. This will bring spells of rain to many areas, perhaps heavy at times, with a risk of strong winds in places. Drier and brighter intervals are likely between systems. Temperatures will probably be near normal or slightly above. Updated: 15:00 (UTC+1) on Fri 16 May 2025 Saturday 31 May - Saturday 14 Jun Changeable weather conditions are expected as we head into June. Spells of wet weather with showers or longer spells of rain are likely to be interspersed with drier, sunnier periods. Overall, it will likely be wetter in the west and drier in the east. Temperatures will probably average out around normal, although some very warm or even hot spells are still possible, as normal for the time of year.

The atomic number density (N; atoms/cm 3 ) of a pure material having an atomic or molecular weight (M; grams/mol) and the material density (⍴; gram/cm 3 ) is easily computed from the following equation using Avogadro’s number ( N A = 6.022×10 23 atoms or molecules per mole): It was written the macroscopic cross-section is derived from microscopic cross-section and the atomic number density (N) : Σ=σ.N In this equation, the atomic number density plays a crucial role as the microscopic cross-section. In the reactor core , the atomic number density of certain materials (e.g.,, water as the moderator ) can be simply changed, leading to certain reactivity changes . To understand the nature of these reactivity changes , we must understand the term the atomic number density. Atomic Number Density of Mixtures and Compounds For a chemical compound (mixture) Z or for an isotopic mixture, which is composed of elements or isotopes X and Y, the number (atom) density of the compound is calculated from: Example – Atomic number densities of boron carbide A control rod usually contains solid boron carbide with natural boron. Natural boron consists primarily of two stable isotopes, 11 B (80.1%) and 10 B (19.9%). Boron carbide has a density of 2.52 g/cm 3 . Determine the atomic number densities of individual constituents.

Cornflower is a member of the Asteracea or Compositae family, which is a large and widespread group of plants that includes sunflowers, daisies, and asters. The soft, frilly double blossoms with fringed petals and delicate gray-green feather foliage make them an excellent cut flower, complemented by zinnias, calendula and other brightly colored cutting garden blossoms. Starter plants for Cornflowers are available in most garden centers, yet often lack the diversity of colors, making this a good reason to start from seeds. Coneflowers are often used as a boutonniere in weddings, and because of their popularity, have been bred to produce plants for a wider range of blossom colors, which included white, pink, red purple, deep burgundy (sometimes called black) and the crisp blue which is the only true natural color. When & Where to Plant Cornflower Light: Full sun, open fields. Soil: Moist, well-drained soil. Can tolerate drought conditions, once established. Spacing: Allow 8-12 inches in between plants. Planting: Sow seeds in early spring for summer blooming plants. In more moderate climates, seeds can be sown in early fall, and established plants will bloom the following spring and summer. Cornflower or Bachelor Button Seeds Cornflower or Bachelor Button Seedlings How to Grow Cornflower Throughout the Season Growth Habit: Cornflowers vary in size, depending on the variety. Shorter types are best in the front of the border, while taller varieties are best mid-garden. Plants tend to grow upright, rather than spread, yet the more blossoms are cut, the more buds they will produce and the plants will get bushy and full. Staking: No staking is required, unless grown in a greenhouse for cut flower trade. Watering: Cornflowers are generally tolerant of drought conditions, yet thrive when watered frequently. Fertilizing: In early spring, work fertilizer into the soil. Side dress in mid-summer with a well-balanced fertilizer, or one with higher phosphorous to boost flower production. Mulching: Cornflowers benefit from mulching with bark mulch, to protect from drying out and too much sun to the root system.

Integral transform ). It is a linear operator $F$ acting on a space whose elements are functions $f$ of $n$ real variables. The smallest domain of definition of $F$ is the set $D=C_0^\\infty$ of all infinitely-differentiable functions $\\phi$ of compact support. For such functions \\begin{equation} (F\\phi)(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}} \\cdot \\int_{\\mathbf R^n} \\phi(\\xi) e^{-i x \\xi} \\, \\mathrm d\\xi. \\end{equation} In a certain sense the most natural domain of definition of $F$ is the set $S$ of all infinitely-differentiable functions $\\phi$ that, together with their derivatives, vanish at infinity faster than any power of $\\frac{1}{|x|}$. Formula (1) still holds for $\\phi\\in S$, and $(F \\phi)(x) \\equiv \\psi(x)\\in S$. Moreover, $F$ is an isomorphism of $S$ onto itself, the inverse mapping $F^{-1}$ (the inverse Fourier transform) is the inverse of the Fourier transform and is given by the formula: \\begin{equation} \\phi(x) = (F^{-1} \\psi)(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}} \\cdot \\int_{\\mathbf R^n} \\psi(\\xi) e^{i x \\xi} \\, \\mathrm d\\xi. \\end{equation} Formula (1) also acts on the space $L_{1}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ of integrable functions. In order to enlarge the domain of definition of the operator $F$ generalization of (1) is necessary. In classical analysis such a generalization has been constructed for locally integrable functions with some restriction on their behaviour as $|x| o\\infty$ (see Fourier integral ). In the theory of generalized functions the definition of the operator $F$ is free of many requirements of classical analysis. The basic problems connected with the study of the Fourier transform $F$ are: the investigation of the domain of definition $ \\Phi $\nand the range of values $ F \\Phi = \\Psi $\nof $ F $; \nas well as studying properties of the mapping $ F: \\ \\Phi \\rightarrow \\Psi $(\nin particular, conditions for the existence of the inverse operator $ F ^ {\\ -1} $\nand its expression). The inversion formula for the Fourier transform is very simple: $$ \nF ^ {\\ -1} [g (x)] \\ = \\ F [g (-x)].\n$$ Under the action of the Fourier transform linear operators on the original space, which are invariant with respect to a shift, become (under certain conditions) multiplication operators in the image space. In particular, the convolution of two functions $ f $\nand $ g $\ngoes over into the product of the functions $ Ff $\nand $ Fg $: $$ \nF (f * g) \\ = \\ Ff \\cdot Fg;\n$$ and differentiation induces multiplication by the independent variable: $$ \nF (D^ \\alpha f \\ ) \\ = \\ (ix)^ \\alpha Ff.\n$$ In the spaces $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $, \n$ 1 \\leq p \\leq 2 $, \nthe operator $ F $\nis defined by the formula (1) on the set $ D _{F} = (L _{1} \\cap L _{p} ) ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\nand is a bounded operator from $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\ninto $ L _{q} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $, \n$ p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1 $: \\begin{equation} \\left\\{\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n / 2}} \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}|(F f)(x)|^{q} d x\\right\\}^{1 / q} \\leq\\left\\{\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n / 2}} \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}|f(x)|^{p} d x\\right\\}^{1 / p} \\end{equation} (the Hausdorff–Young inequality). $ F $\nadmits a continuous extension onto the whole space $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\nwhich (for $ 1 < p \\leq 2 $) \nis given by $$ ag{3}\n(Ff \\ ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\lim\\limits _ {R \\rightarrow \\infty} {}^{q} \\ \n{\n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n/2}\n}\n\\int\\limits _ {| \\xi | < R}\nf ( \\xi ) e ^ {-i \\xi x} \\ \nd \\xi \\ = \\ \\widetilde{f} (x).\n$$ Convergence is understood to be in the norm of $ L _{q} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $. \nIf $ p eq 2 $, \nthe image of $ L _{p} $\nunder the action of $ F $\ndoes not coincide with $ L _{q} $, \nthat is, the imbedding $ FL _{p} \\subset L _{q} $\nis strict when $ 1 \\leq p < 2 $(\nfor the case $ p = 2 $\nsee Plancherel theorem ). The inverse operator $ F ^ {\\ -1} $\nis defined on $ FL _{p} $\nby $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\widetilde{f} \\ ) \\ = \\ \n\\lim\\limits _ {R \\rightarrow \\infty} {}^{p} \\ \n{\n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n/2}\n}\n\\int\\limits _ {| \\xi | < R}\n\\widetilde{f} ( \\xi )\ne ^ {i \\xi x} \\ d \\xi ,\\ \\ \n1 < p \\leq 2.\n$$ The problem of extending the Fourier transform to a larger class of functions arises constantly in analysis and its applications. See, for example, Fourier transform of a generalized function . References [1] E.C. Titchmarsh, \"Introduction to the theory of Fourier integrals\" , Oxford Univ. Press (1948) [2] A. Zygmund, \"Trigonometric series\" , 2 , Cambridge Univ. Press (1988) [3] E.M. Stein, G. Weiss, \"Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces\" , Princeton Univ. Press (1971) Comments Instead of \"generalized function\" the term \"distributiondistribution\" is often used. If $ x = (x _{1} \\dots x _{n} ) $\nand $ \\xi = ( \\xi _{1} \\dots \\xi _{n} ) $\nthen $ x \\cdot \\xi $\ndenotes the scalar product $ \\sum _{ {i = 1}^{n}} x _{i} \\xi _{i} $. If in (1) the \"normalizing factor\" $ (1/ {2 \\pi} )^{n/2} $\nis replaced by some constant $ \\alpha $, \nthen in (2) it must be replaced by $ \\beta $\nwith $ \\alpha \\beta = (1/ {2 \\pi} )^{n} $. At least two other conventions for the \"normalization factor\" are in common use: $$ ag{a1}\n(F \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R ^ n}\n\\phi ( \\xi )\ne ^ {- ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ \nd \\xi ,\n$$ $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n}\n \\int\\limits _\n{\\mathbf R ^ n} \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi ,\n$$ $$ ag{a2}\n(F \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R ^ n} \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {- 2 \\pi ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi ,\n$$ $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R^{n} } \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {2 \\pi ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi .\n$$ The convention of the article leads to the Fourier transform as a unitary operator from $ L _{2} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\ninto itself, and so does the convention (a2). Convention (a1) is more in line with harmonic analysis . References [a1] W. Rudin, \"Functional analysis\" , McGraw-Hill (1973) How to Cite This Entry: Fourier transform. Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

Integral transform ). It is a linear operator $F$ acting on a space whose elements are functions $f$ of $n$ real variables. The smallest domain of definition of $F$ is the set $D=C_0^\\infty$ of all infinitely-differentiable functions $\\phi$ of compact support. For such functions \\begin{equation} (F\\phi)(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}} \\cdot \\int_{\\mathbf R^n} \\phi(\\xi) e^{-i x \\xi} \\, \\mathrm d\\xi. \\end{equation} In a certain sense the most natural domain of definition of $F$ is the set $S$ of all infinitely-differentiable functions $\\phi$ that, together with their derivatives, vanish at infinity faster than any power of $\\frac{1}{|x|}$. Formula (1) still holds for $\\phi\\in S$, and $(F \\phi)(x) \\equiv \\psi(x)\\in S$. Moreover, $F$ is an isomorphism of $S$ onto itself, the inverse mapping $F^{-1}$ (the inverse Fourier transform) is the inverse of the Fourier transform and is given by the formula: \\begin{equation} \\phi(x) = (F^{-1} \\psi)(x) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}} \\cdot \\int_{\\mathbf R^n} \\psi(\\xi) e^{i x \\xi} \\, \\mathrm d\\xi. \\end{equation} Formula (1) also acts on the space $L_{1}\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{n}\\right)$ of integrable functions. In order to enlarge the domain of definition of the operator $F$ generalization of (1) is necessary. In classical analysis such a generalization has been constructed for locally integrable functions with some restriction on their behaviour as $|x| o\\infty$ (see Fourier integral ). In the theory of generalized functions the definition of the operator $F$ is free of many requirements of classical analysis. The basic problems connected with the study of the Fourier transform $F$ are: the investigation of the domain of definition $ \\Phi $\nand the range of values $ F \\Phi = \\Psi $\nof $ F $; \nas well as studying properties of the mapping $ F: \\ \\Phi \\rightarrow \\Psi $(\nin particular, conditions for the existence of the inverse operator $ F ^ {\\ -1} $\nand its expression). The inversion formula for the Fourier transform is very simple: $$ \nF ^ {\\ -1} [g (x)] \\ = \\ F [g (-x)].\n$$ Under the action of the Fourier transform linear operators on the original space, which are invariant with respect to a shift, become (under certain conditions) multiplication operators in the image space. In particular, the convolution of two functions $ f $\nand $ g $\ngoes over into the product of the functions $ Ff $\nand $ Fg $: $$ \nF (f * g) \\ = \\ Ff \\cdot Fg;\n$$ and differentiation induces multiplication by the independent variable: $$ \nF (D^ \\alpha f \\ ) \\ = \\ (ix)^ \\alpha Ff.\n$$ In the spaces $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $, \n$ 1 \\leq p \\leq 2 $, \nthe operator $ F $\nis defined by the formula (1) on the set $ D _{F} = (L _{1} \\cap L _{p} ) ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\nand is a bounded operator from $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\ninto $ L _{q} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $, \n$ p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1 $: \\begin{equation} \\left\\{\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n / 2}} \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}|(F f)(x)|^{q} d x\\right\\}^{1 / q} \\leq\\left\\{\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{n / 2}} \\int_{\\mathbf{R}^{n}}|f(x)|^{p} d x\\right\\}^{1 / p} \\end{equation} (the Hausdorff–Young inequality). $ F $\nadmits a continuous extension onto the whole space $ L _{p} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\nwhich (for $ 1 < p \\leq 2 $) \nis given by $$ ag{3}\n(Ff \\ ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\lim\\limits _ {R \\rightarrow \\infty} {}^{q} \\ \n{\n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n/2}\n}\n\\int\\limits _ {| \\xi | < R}\nf ( \\xi ) e ^ {-i \\xi x} \\ \nd \\xi \\ = \\ \\widetilde{f} (x).\n$$ Convergence is understood to be in the norm of $ L _{q} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $. \nIf $ p eq 2 $, \nthe image of $ L _{p} $\nunder the action of $ F $\ndoes not coincide with $ L _{q} $, \nthat is, the imbedding $ FL _{p} \\subset L _{q} $\nis strict when $ 1 \\leq p < 2 $(\nfor the case $ p = 2 $\nsee Plancherel theorem ). The inverse operator $ F ^ {\\ -1} $\nis defined on $ FL _{p} $\nby $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\widetilde{f} \\ ) \\ = \\ \n\\lim\\limits _ {R \\rightarrow \\infty} {}^{p} \\ \n{\n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n/2}\n}\n\\int\\limits _ {| \\xi | < R}\n\\widetilde{f} ( \\xi )\ne ^ {i \\xi x} \\ d \\xi ,\\ \\ \n1 < p \\leq 2.\n$$ The problem of extending the Fourier transform to a larger class of functions arises constantly in analysis and its applications. See, for example, Fourier transform of a generalized function . References [1] E.C. Titchmarsh, \"Introduction to the theory of Fourier integrals\" , Oxford Univ. Press (1948) [2] A. Zygmund, \"Trigonometric series\" , 2 , Cambridge Univ. Press (1988) [3] E.M. Stein, G. Weiss, \"Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces\" , Princeton Univ. Press (1971) Comments Instead of \"generalized function\" the term \"distributiondistribution\" is often used. If $ x = (x _{1} \\dots x _{n} ) $\nand $ \\xi = ( \\xi _{1} \\dots \\xi _{n} ) $\nthen $ x \\cdot \\xi $\ndenotes the scalar product $ \\sum _{ {i = 1}^{n}} x _{i} \\xi _{i} $. If in (1) the \"normalizing factor\" $ (1/ {2 \\pi} )^{n/2} $\nis replaced by some constant $ \\alpha $, \nthen in (2) it must be replaced by $ \\beta $\nwith $ \\alpha \\beta = (1/ {2 \\pi} )^{n} $. At least two other conventions for the \"normalization factor\" are in common use: $$ ag{a1}\n(F \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R ^ n}\n\\phi ( \\xi )\ne ^ {- ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ \nd \\xi ,\n$$ $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \n\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi ) ^ n}\n \\int\\limits _\n{\\mathbf R ^ n} \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi ,\n$$ $$ ag{a2}\n(F \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R ^ n} \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {- 2 \\pi ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi ,\n$$ $$ \n(F ^ {\\ -1} \\phi ) (x) \\ = \\ \\int\\limits _ {\\mathbf R^{n} } \\phi ( \\xi ) e ^ {2 \\pi ix \\cdot \\xi} \\ d \\xi .\n$$ The convention of the article leads to the Fourier transform as a unitary operator from $ L _{2} ( \\mathbf R^{n} ) $\ninto itself, and so does the convention (a2). Convention (a1) is more in line with harmonic analysis . References [a1] W. Rudin, \"Functional analysis\" , McGraw-Hill (1973) How to Cite This Entry: Fourier transform. Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

Lesson on Matrix Multiplication Lesson Contents Rules of Multiplication Matrix multiplication adheres to different rules than matrix addition and subtraction. When multiplying a matrix by another matrix, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. The first matrix may have any number of rows and the second matrix may have any number of columns. The output matrix dimensions are defined by the dimensions of the input matrices. The formula for such is given as: m×n x n×p → m×p Where matrix A is of dimensions m×n, matrix B is of dimensions n×p, and matrix C is of dimensions m×p. How to Multiply a Matrix by Another Matrix To multiply two matrices, we perform the dot product of rows and columns from matrix A and matrix B respectively. Consider each row of matrix A a vector with a number of components equal to the number of columns n . Then, consider each column of matrix B a vector with a number of components equal to the number of rows n . Below is a literal example of using dot products to multiply a 3×2 matrix A by a 2×3 matrix B . [ a 1 i a 1 j a 2 i a 2 j a 3 i a 3 j ] × [ b 1 i b 2 i b 3 i b 1 j b 2 j b 3 j ] = [ a 1 ⋅ b 1 a 1 ⋅ b 2 a 1 ⋅ b 3 a 2 ⋅ b 1 a 2 ⋅ b 2 a 2 ⋅ b 3 a 3 ⋅ b 1 a 3 ⋅ b 2 a 3 ⋅ b 3 ] How the Calculator Works The calculator on this page is written in the programming language JavaScript (JS) and runs in your device’s internet browser JS engine, allowing for near-instant solutions at the click of a button.

    "html": "Series Circuit - StickMan Physics Skip to content StickMan Physics Animated Physics Lessons Menu Series Circuit Series Circuits In a series circuit components like resistors and loads are connected in a single path.  Current must go through every component in order starting from the positive terminal of the battery through everything in order and back to the negative battery terminal. Practice and Series Circuit Virtual Lab Sheet Series Circuits vs. Parallel Circuits Series Circuits only have one path while parallel circuits we will see in a later unit have branches.  Compare the pictures below each with three resistors. Lights in a Series Circuit Compared to a Parallel Circuit When lights are connected in a series circuit and one goes out the circuit becomes open and no other light works.  This is because there is no path to the negative terminal of the battery when a circuit is open. When lights are connected in parallel circuit and one light goes out the remaining ones stay on.  No current will flow down the branch with the disconnected light bulb since that branch is open.  Current will follow the other paths to the negative terminal of the battery leaving the other lights on. Series Circuit Diagrams To keep the models simple we will only places a battery and resistors in the circuits of our diagrams on this page.  Remember that the longer line in the battery symbol is the positive terminal and the shorter line is the negative terminal.  The convention is to have current run from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.  Due to this convention the resistors are numbered in order.  Here the resistors get their number resistor 1, resistor 2, and resistor 3 based on the flow of current starting from the positive terminal of the battery. Series Circuit Rules Voltage Drop In A Series Circuit In a series circuit voltage drops across each resistor until the entire amount provided by the battery has dropped.  If you add all the individual voltage drops of a series circuit together you can determine the voltage of the entire circuit (V T ) found at the power source. Current in a Series Circuit There is only one path in a series circuit for current to travel on.  All current must run from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the power source.  Observe the animation of how the same current has to flow through every component of the circuit in series. Resistance in a Series Circuit Any resistor or load (device with a resistance) in a series acts like a speed bump in a series slowing current down .  Since there is only one conductive path in series every device adds to total resistance. Note that a wire itself has resistance and the less conductive a wire is the more resistance it would add to a circuit.  We will ignore this in our examples below for simplicity and pretend the wire was 100% conductive. Circuit Equations Ohm’s Law (V=IR) , Voltage equals current times resistance, can be used anywhere in the circuit but only at a single location. See all the squares in red above, if you are using Ohm’s law you can only use information in that location, the V,I, and R within a single square . The location can be an individual resistor, for example resistor one with the variables Voltage (V 1 ), Current (I 1 ), Resistance (R 1 ).  The location can also be at the battery, which is a measure that represents the overall circuits voltage (V T ), current (I T ), and Resistance (R T ). At the battery the subscript T (ex. V T ) stands for total or of the circuit.  Some equations sheets may use emf (ex. V emf ) or another notation, if there is any subscript other than a number it will likely be of the circuit. When you are using information between different red blocks you must use the series circuit rules . Start any problem by drawing out the circuit and have every resistor labeled as you see in the picture above.  Then write in all your givens.  Next, follow the basic steps to a series circuit problem. Basic Steps To A Series Circuit Problem I T = I 1 = I 2 = I 3 = … V T = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 + … R T = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + … You will continue to follow these steps over and over until everything in the circuit is complete.  Follow our examples below until you feel comfortable to follow the steps solving series circuit problems on your own. Example Problem 1 Example 1 Step 1 Here we don’t have enough information to use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) at any location so we need to look at the series circuit equations V T = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 + … I T = I 1 = I 2 = I 3 = … R T = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + … We can use the last of the equations to solve for the resistance of the circuit (at the battery first).  We only have three resistors so we leave off any other part not in this circuit from the equation R T = 15Ω + 20Ω + 5Ω = 40Ω Example 1 Step 2 Now we have enough information to use Ohm’s law at the battery to determine the current (I T ) at the battery I T =80V/40Ω = 2A Example 1 Step 3 Now that we know current at any location, in this case the battery, we know it everywhere in a series circuit I T = 2A I 1 = 2A I 2 = 2A I 3 = 2A Example 1 Step 4 Now we have enough information to solve for voltage everywhere using Ohm’s Law (V=IR) V 1 = 2A x 15Ω = 30V V 2 = 2A x 20Ω = 40 V V 3 = 2A x 5Ω = 10 V It is important to make one final check.  Since we finished using Ohm’s Law to solve for V 3 , lets make sure this last step also fits with the series circuit rule. 80V = 30V + 40V + 10V This is also mathematically correct so we know we solved for all the parts of this circuit correctly.  If it did not we would know we had an error and would have to trace back our steps or starting over is sometimes easier. Example Problem 2 Note:  While our example stick to whole numbers for simplicity, this would be very uncommon and you would normally have decimals . Do not be shocked if you have decimals , just make sure all the rules are followed and do a final check as presented in the examples below. Example 2 Step 1 You have enough information to start this circuit at the first resistor using Ohm’s Law (V=IR) V 1 = I 1 x R 1 rearranges to I 1 = V 1 /R 1 when solving for current. I 1 = 6V/3Ω = 2A Example 2 Step 2 Now that we know current at the at one location, the first resistor, we know it’s the same everywhere following series circuit rules. 2A = 2A = 2A = 2A Example 2 Step 3 Now we have enough information to use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) to solve for resistance of the circuit (at the battery) and voltage at resistor 2 R T = 12V/2A = 6Ω V 2 = 2A x 2Ω = 4V Now our circuit looks like this Example 2 Step 4 From here we can solve for either voltage or resistance of resistor 3 using the overall series circuit rules. V 3 = 12V – 6V – 4V V 3 = 2V R 3 = 6Ω  – 3Ω – 2Ω R 3 = 1Ω Since we solved for R 3 last using series circuit rules do the final check at resistor three making sure it follows Ohm’s Law at this location as well. 2V = 2A x 1Ω It makes the final check so we know we solved for the parts of this circuit correctly. Example Problem 3 Example 3 Step 1 In this circuit we don’t have enough information to start with Ohm’s Law since we don’t have two out of three parts of Ohm’s Law at any one location. 20Ω = R 1 + 10Ω + 4Ω R 1 = 20Ω – 10Ω – 4Ω = 6Ω Our circuit now looks like this Example 3 Step 2 Now we can solve for current at resistor 1 using Ohm’s Law I 1 = 12V/6Ω = 2A Example 3 Step 3 Now that we know current in one location we know the current everywhere in the circuit following the series circuit rules. 2A = 2A = 2A = 2A Our circuit now looks like this Example 3 Step 4 Now use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) to solve for all the remaining components since we have enough information to do so. V T = 2A x 20Ω = 40V V 2 = 2A x 10Ω = 20V V 3 = 2A x 4Ω = 8V Our circuit now looks like this Since we ended by solving for V 3 using Ohm’s Law, our final check is to make sure voltage also follow the series circuit rules for voltage. 40V = 12V + 20V + 8V This is a correct mathematical statement so we know we solved our series circuit correctly. Some problems as the one seen below are drawn showing multimeters taking the reading of the current as seen below.  This is not part of the circuit and is just taking a reading. You would rewrite the problem above taking out the multimeters and placing the readings into the problem and start the problem as seen in example 4 below. Example Problem 4 Try example 4 on your own and click “See Solution” to check your answers. See Solution Another Way Current Can Be Given In A Series Circuit Problem Be aware that current can also be drawn into a problem in the wire and not at a single resistor.  This is not an additional resistor but seeing the current drawn as a circle over the wire shows you the current in that wire.  Since there is only one wire going from the previous resistor to the new resistor, you know in series both of those must have that current as well.  See the picture to see a visual of this.

When lights are connected in parallel circuit and one light goes out the remaining ones stay on.  No current will flow down the branch with the disconnected light bulb since that branch is open.  Current will follow the other paths to the negative terminal of the battery leaving the other lights on. Series Circuit Diagrams To keep the models simple we will only places a battery and resistors in the circuits of our diagrams on this page.  Remember that the longer line in the battery symbol is the positive terminal and the shorter line is the negative terminal.  The convention is to have current run from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.  Due to this convention the resistors are numbered in order.  Here the resistors get their number resistor 1, resistor 2, and resistor 3 based on the flow of current starting from the positive terminal of the battery. Series Circuit Rules Voltage Drop In A Series Circuit In a series circuit voltage drops across each resistor until the entire amount provided by the battery has dropped.  If you add all the individual voltage drops of a series circuit together you can determine the voltage of the entire circuit (V T ) found at the power source. Current in a Series Circuit There is only one path in a series circuit for current to travel on.  All current must run from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the power source.  Observe the animation of how the same current has to flow through every component of the circuit in series. Resistance in a Series Circuit Any resistor or load (device with a resistance) in a series acts like a speed bump in a series slowing current down .  Since there is only one conductive path in series every device adds to total resistance. Note that a wire itself has resistance and the less conductive a wire is the more resistance it would add to a circuit.  We will ignore this in our examples below for simplicity and pretend the wire was 100% conductive. Circuit Equations Ohm’s Law (V=IR) , Voltage equals current times resistance, can be used anywhere in the circuit but only at a single location. See all the squares in red above, if you are using Ohm’s law you can only use information in that location, the V,I, and R within a single square . The location can be an individual resistor, for example resistor one with the variables Voltage (V 1 ), Current (I 1 ), Resistance (R 1 ).  The location can also be at the battery, which is a measure that represents the overall circuits voltage (V T ), current (I T ), and Resistance (R T ). At the battery the subscript T (ex. V T ) stands for total or of the circuit.  Some equations sheets may use emf (ex. V emf ) or another notation, if there is any subscript other than a number it will likely be of the circuit. When you are using information between different red blocks you must use the series circuit rules . Start any problem by drawing out the circuit and have every resistor labeled as you see in the picture above.  Then write in all your givens.  Next, follow the basic steps to a series circuit problem. Basic Steps To A Series Circuit Problem I T = I 1 = I 2 = I 3 = … V T = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 + … R T = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + … You will continue to follow these steps over and over until everything in the circuit is complete.  Follow our examples below until you feel comfortable to follow the steps solving series circuit problems on your own. Example Problem 1 Example 1 Step 1 Here we don’t have enough information to use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) at any location so we need to look at the series circuit equations V T = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 + … I T = I 1 = I 2 = I 3 = … R T = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + … We can use the last of the equations to solve for the resistance of the circuit (at the battery first).  We only have three resistors so we leave off any other part not in this circuit from the equation R T = 15Ω + 20Ω + 5Ω = 40Ω Example 1 Step 2 Now we have enough information to use Ohm’s law at the battery to determine the current (I T ) at the battery I T =80V/40Ω = 2A Example 1 Step 3 Now that we know current at any location, in this case the battery, we know it everywhere in a series circuit I T = 2A I 1 = 2A I 2 = 2A I 3 = 2A Example 1 Step 4 Now we have enough information to solve for voltage everywhere using Ohm’s Law (V=IR) V 1 = 2A x 15Ω = 30V V 2 = 2A x 20Ω = 40 V V 3 = 2A x 5Ω = 10 V It is important to make one final check.  Since we finished using Ohm’s Law to solve for V 3 , lets make sure this last step also fits with the series circuit rule. 80V = 30V + 40V + 10V This is also mathematically correct so we know we solved for all the parts of this circuit correctly.  If it did not we would know we had an error and would have to trace back our steps or starting over is sometimes easier. Example Problem 2 Note:  While our example stick to whole numbers for simplicity, this would be very uncommon and you would normally have decimals . Do not be shocked if you have decimals , just make sure all the rules are followed and do a final check as presented in the examples below. Example 2 Step 1 You have enough information to start this circuit at the first resistor using Ohm’s Law (V=IR) V 1 = I 1 x R 1 rearranges to I 1 = V 1 /R 1 when solving for current. I 1 = 6V/3Ω = 2A Example 2 Step 2 Now that we know current at the at one location, the first resistor, we know it’s the same everywhere following series circuit rules. 2A = 2A = 2A = 2A Example 2 Step 3 Now we have enough information to use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) to solve for resistance of the circuit (at the battery) and voltage at resistor 2 R T = 12V/2A = 6Ω V 2 = 2A x 2Ω = 4V Now our circuit looks like this Example 2 Step 4 From here we can solve for either voltage or resistance of resistor 3 using the overall series circuit rules. V 3 = 12V – 6V – 4V V 3 = 2V R 3 = 6Ω  – 3Ω – 2Ω R 3 = 1Ω Since we solved for R 3 last using series circuit rules do the final check at resistor three making sure it follows Ohm’s Law at this location as well. 2V = 2A x 1Ω It makes the final check so we know we solved for the parts of this circuit correctly. Example Problem 3 Example 3 Step 1 In this circuit we don’t have enough information to start with Ohm’s Law since we don’t have two out of three parts of Ohm’s Law at any one location. 20Ω = R 1 + 10Ω + 4Ω R 1 = 20Ω – 10Ω – 4Ω = 6Ω Our circuit now looks like this Example 3 Step 2 Now we can solve for current at resistor 1 using Ohm’s Law I 1 = 12V/6Ω = 2A Example 3 Step 3 Now that we know current in one location we know the current everywhere in the circuit following the series circuit rules. 2A = 2A = 2A = 2A Our circuit now looks like this Example 3 Step 4 Now use Ohm’s Law (V=IR) to solve for all the remaining components since we have enough information to do so. V T = 2A x 20Ω = 40V V 2 = 2A x 10Ω = 20V V 3 = 2A x 4Ω = 8V Our circuit now looks like this Since we ended by solving for V 3 using Ohm’s Law, our final check is to make sure voltage also follow the series circuit rules for voltage. 40V = 12V + 20V + 8V This is a correct mathematical statement so we know we solved our series circuit correctly. Some problems as the one seen below are drawn showing multimeters taking the reading of the current as seen below.  This is not part of the circuit and is just taking a reading. You would rewrite the problem above taking out the multimeters and placing the readings into the problem and start the problem as seen in example 4 below. Example Problem 4 Try example 4 on your own and click “See Solution” to check your answers. See Solution Another Way Current Can Be Given In A Series Circuit Problem Be aware that current can also be drawn into a problem in the wire and not at a single resistor.  This is not an additional resistor but seeing the current drawn as a circle over the wire shows you the current in that wire.  Since there is only one wire going from the previous resistor to the new resistor, you know in series both of those must have that current as well.  See the picture to see a visual of this.

Find it in our gardens Our work More about this plant One of the most popular flavours in the world, vanilla was first used by Aztec people in Mexico to flavour cocoa. It comes from the dried and cured fruits (pods) of the orchid Vanilla planifolia . This plant grows in the tropical forests of Mexico and Central and northern South America but is now rare in the wild due to habitat reduction and overexploitation. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice after saffron because of the intensive labour required to grow its pods. Plant description Vanilla is an evergreen vine that can reach up to 15m in length. It has thick stems and greenish to yellow flowers. The fruits are long, thin pods that contain thousands of tiny, black seeds. Vanilla has fleshy aerial roots that cling to trees and allow it to climb.

Food and drink The whole fruit (pod) or tiny seeds of vanilla are used as flavouring agents in food, including cream and custard-based sauces and confectionery. Health The main flavour molecule in vanilla, vanillin, has antimicrobial properties. Vanilla has been used as an aphrodisiac and stimulant, and to relieve fevers and aid digestion. However, further research is needed to prove vanilla has these medicinal properties. Vanilla products must be taken with care as they can cause an allergic response. Did you know? Outside of its native range, cultivated vanilla plants must be hand pollinated. The hand-pollination technique that is still used to this day was perfected in 1841 by a 12-year-old boy . Much of the 'vanilla essence' commonly used today is actually made from wood pulp or coal tar . Vanilla is one of the only orchids that produces fruit with huge economic value . The distinctive aroma and flavour of vanilla is only released when the fruit is dried and cured by steaming and fermentation. Where in the world?

Location In the tropical orchid zone of our Princess of Wales Conservatory and behind the scenes in our Tropical Nursery. View map of Kew Gardens Our work Experts in our horticulture team here at Kew have perfected the art of propagation of the vanilla orchid. We take cuttings from the stem and a minimum of three leaves and place them on moss. The cuttings are kept damp in a warm and humid environment until new growth starts. We then plant them into hanging baskets with a compost mix made up of bark chips, pumice and charcoal that is only watered when it dries out. We mist the aerial roots once a day. When in propagation, we keep the plants in a warm zone of the Tropical Nursery at Kew, with a minimum night temperature of 20˚C, and shaded when necessary. Our horticulturalists also delicately hand pollinate the flowers of our vanilla plants to get some fruits (pods) as the usual pollinator of this plant, the Melipona bee, does not live outside of its native range. This is an extremely tricky process done with a slim toothpick, with the added complication that this plant flowers irregularly when in cultivation and when it does, the flowers are only open for eight hours. The pod can take around 3 weeks to form from pollination and if successful a whole year to ripen. So, it is clear how this delicate flower has become such a global commodity.

There are a few different ways to write the equation of a line.  One of the most common ways is called \"slope-intercept\" form .  It's called this because it clearly identifies the slope and the y-intercept in the equation.  The slope is the number written before the x.  The y-intercept is the constant written at the end. Let's look at an example: y = 3x + 2.  The coefficient of the x-term is 3, this means the line has a slope of 3.  The constant being added at the end is 2.  This means the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis) is at positive 2. What do you do if there's a minus sign in between the two terms?  For example, what about the equation y = 5x - 8?  We can rewrite subtracting 8 as adding a negative 8.  This means the y-intercept is at -8. Using Points to Write Slope-Intercept Equation If you know two points on a line, you can use them to write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form. The first step will be to use the points to find the slope of the line.  This will give you the value of m that you can plug into y = mx + b.  The second step will be to find the y-intercept. Once you know m and b, you can write the equation of the line. Step 1:  Find the slope (m) The slope of the line through two points ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) can be found by using the formula below. Make sure to check out our lesson on using points to find slope if you need extra help on this step.  Don't forget slope is rise over run: subtract the y-values in the numerator to get the rise and subtract the x-values in the denominator (in the same order!) to get the run. Once you know the slope of the line, plug it in for m in y = mx + b.  For example, if you used the formula and found that the slope is 2, you would write y = 2x + b.   The example below shows the first steps you would take if you needed to write an equation of the line through the points (2,5) and (4,13). Welcome to Kate's Math Lessons! Teachers,make sure to check out the study guides and activities . Step 2:  Find the y-intercept (b) Once you know the slope (m), you're halfway there.  Now all that's left to find is the y-intercept (b).  To find the y-intercept, choose one of the points on the line. It does not matter which point you choose (just pick the one that looks easiest to you).  Plug in the values for x and y into the equation and solve for b. Step 3:  Write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) At this point, you've solved for both m and b.  All that's left to do is to plug them both in and write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). Step 4:  Check Your Equation It's always a good idea to check your work when possible.  To double check the accuracy of your equation, you can use the other point that's on the line ( the one you didn't use in Step 2 to find b).  Plug in the x value from this point into your y = mx + b equation and see if it comes out to the correct y value. Example 2: Write the equation of the line through (4,7) and (6,13) Step 1: Find the slope (m). Use the formula to find the slope between the two points. Once you know the slope, plug it in for m in y = mx + b.  This gives you y = 3x + b. ​ Step 2: Find the y-intercept (b). Pick one of the points on the line and use the x and y values to find b.  It does not matter which point you choose.  We'll pick the first point (4,7) and plug in 4 for x and 7 for y. ​ Step 3: Write the equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) ​Now that we know m = 3 and b = -5, we can plug these values in and write the equation in slope-intercept form. Step 4: Check your answer ​We used the point (4,7) in Step 2, so to check our equation we need to use the other point: (6,13).  If you use the same point twice, it will not find a mistake.  Make sure to use the point you didn't use to find the y-intercept in Step 2. Plug in the x value from the other point and see if it works.  If we plug in 6 for x in our equation, the y value should come out to 13. 3(6) - 5 = 18 - 5 = 13.  It works! If we had plugged in 6 and it came out to a number that wasn't 13, that would tell us that we had made a mistake somewhere along the way.  If this happens to you, start by double checking to make sure you calculated the slope correctly.  You may have used the formula incorrectly or missed a negative sign somewhere.

From Meter Kilometer Centimeter Millimeter Micrometer Nanometer Mile Yard Foot Inch Light Year Meter Kilometer Centimeter Millimeter Micrometer Nanometer Mile Yard Foot Inch Light Year Convert 300 Millimeters to Inches (mm to in) with our conversion calculator. 300 Millimeters to Inches equals 11.8110 in. To convert 300 millimeters to inches, you use the conversion factor that 1 inch equals 25.4 millimeters. This conversion factor is based on the definitions and agreements in the International System of Units (SI) and the imperial measurement system. The calculation begins by taking the length in millimeters (300 mm) and dividing it by the value of 1 inch in millimeters (25.4 mm/inch). To compute this, the formula is as follows: \\([ ext{Inches} = \\frac{ ext{Millimeters}}{25.4} ]\\) Substituting the given value: \\([ ext{Inches} = \\frac{300}{25.4} \\approx 11.811 ]\\) Therefore, 300 mm is approximately equal to 11.811 inches when rounded to three decimal places. This conversion process relies on understanding both the metric and imperial systems of measurement, allowing for precise and universally understandable calculations that facilitate conversions between these two systems. Here are 7 items that are around 300 mm (or approximately 11.811 inches) in length: A Standard Ruler : Typically, a ruler might be 30 cm (or 300 mm), which is standard for measuring objects in both school and professional settings. A tool for drawing straight lines and measuring objects. Keyboard Length : Many compact keyboards are approximately this length, allowing for comfortable typing. An input device used for typing on computers and other electronic devices. A Sheet of A4 Paper Lengthwise : A4 paper measures 297 mm in length, very close to 300 mm. Standard paper size used for printing documents and letters. A Skateboard Deck Width : Some skateboard decks can be around 300 mm wide, providing the platform for skating tricks and travel. A flat board with wheels used for skateboarding. Laptop Screen : Some small laptops or netbooks feature a diagonal screen size close to this measurement. The display unit of a laptop used for visual output. A Large Subway Sandwich : Subway offers a foot-long sandwich, which is roughly equivalent to 304.8 mm. A prepared food item consisting of a long bread filled with meats, veggies, and condiments. An Adult Ball Python's Average Width when Coiled : While highly variable, smaller or younger adult ball pythons can coil into a circle of this diameter. A pet snake species known for its manageable size and docile nature. These examples span from everyday objects to living creatures, illustrating the practical application of measuring and relating different items using a standard unit of length such as millimeters or inches.

Count The Number of Each Atom The first step to finding the molar mass of Carbon Dioxide is to count the number of each atom present in a single molecule using the chemical formula, CO2: Element Number of Atoms C (Carbon) 1 O (Oxygen) 2 2. Find Atomic Mass of Each Element Next, using the periodic table , find the atomic mass in g/mol of each element (the molar mass of an element is equal to its atomic mass): Molar Mass (g/mol) C (Carbon) 12.0107 O (Oxygen) 15.9994 3. Compute Mass of Each Element Multiply the number of atoms by the atomic weight of each element found in steps 1 and 2 to get the mass of each element in CO2: Molar Mass (g/mol) C (Carbon) 1 × 12.0107 = 12.0107 O (Oxygen) 2 × 15.9994 = 31.9988 4. Sum Each Element's Mass Finally, add together the total mass of each element to get the molar mass of CO2: 12.0107 g/mol + 31.9988 g/mol = 44.0095 g/mol 5. Find Mole Fraction To find the mole fraction and percentage of each element in CO2, divide each total from step 3 by the total molar mass found in step 4: Mole Fraction Percent C (Carbon) 12.0107 ÷ 44.0095 = 0.272912 × 100 = 27.2912% O (Oxygen) 31.9988 ÷ 44.0095 = 0.727088 × 100 = 72.7088% Recently Balanced Equations CO2 + H2O = C6H12O6 + O2 CO2 + H2O = H2CO3 CO2 + KOH = K2CO3 + H2O CO2 + LiOH = Li2CO3 + H2O CO2 = C + O2 CO2 + NaOH = Na2CO3 + H2O Calculators Equations & Reactions Chemical Equation Balancer Reaction Stoichiometry Calculator Limiting Reagent Calculator Ionic Equation Calculator Redox Calculator Compounds & Formulas Empirical Formula Calculator Molar Mass Calculator Oxidation Number Calculator Solubility Calculator Lewis Structure Calculator Bond Polarity Calculator Calculations Significant Figures Calculator Chemistry Equation Calculators Ideal Gas Law Unit Converter Languages 🇺🇸 English 🇪🇸 español 🇫🇷 français 🇩🇪 Deutsch 🇵🇹 português 🇮🇹 italiano 🇳🇱 Nederlands 🇷🇺 русский 🇵🇱 polski 🇨🇿 čeština 🇸🇰 slovenčina 🇭🇷 hrvatski 🇻🇳 Tiếng Việt 🇮🇩 Indonesia 🇰🇷 한국어 🇯🇵 日本語 🇨🇳 中文 🇸🇦 العربية 🇹🇷 Türkçe",

    "html": "Neon, Chemical Element - water, uses, elements, metal, gas, number, name, symbol Chemistry L-P Neon, Chemical Element NEON Photo by: concept w Overview Neon is a member of the noble gas family. Other elements in this family\n includes helium, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. These gases are in Group 18 (VIIIA) of the periodic table. The periodic\n table is a chart that shows how chemical elements are related to each\n other. The noble gases are sometimes called the inert gases. This name\n comes from the fact that these elements do not react very readily. In\n fact, compounds exist for only three noble gases—krypton, radon,\n and xenon. Chemists have yet to prepare compounds of helium, neon, or argon . Neon was discovered in 1898 by British chemists William Ramsay (1852-1916)\n and Morris Travers (1872-1961). It occurs naturally in the atmosphere, but\n only in very small amounts. SYMBOL Ne ATOMIC NUMBER 10 ATOMIC MASS 20.179 FAMILY Group 18 (VIIIA) Noble gas PRONUNCIATION NEE-on Neon has relatively few uses. The most familiar is neon lighting . Today,\n neon signs of every color, shape, and size exist. Neon signs are often\n filled with neon gas, but they may also contain other gases as well. The\n gas contained in the sign tube determines the color of light given off.\n The color given off by neon itself is reddish-orange. Discovery and naming It took humans centuries to understand air. At one time, philosophers\n thought air was an element. Among the ancient Greeks, for example, the\n four bask elements were air, fire, water, and earth. The first research to disprove that idea was done in the 1770s. In that\n decade, two new elements were discovered in air: nitrogen and oxygen. For some time, chemists were convinced that these two gases were the only\n ones present in air. That idea is easy to understand. Between them, nitrogen and oxygen make up more than 99 percent of air. But over time, chemists became more skilled at making measurements. They\n recognized that something else was in air besides nitrogen and oxygen.\n That \"something else\" accounted for the remaining one\n percent that is not nitrogen or oxygen. In 1894, a third element was\n discovered in air: argon. Argon makes up about 0.934 percent of air. So,\n nitrogen, oxygen, and argon together make up about 99.966 percent of air. But what was responsible for the remaining 0.034 percent of air? Chemists\n knew that other gases must be present in very small amounts. But what were\n those gases? That question was answered between 1895 and 1900. Five more inert gases\n were discovered in air. One of those was neon. Detecting gases in very small amounts was very difficult in the 1890s.\n Equipment was often not good enough to capture a tiny fraction of a\n milliliter of gas. But a new method, called spectroscopy , was developed\n that \"sees\" even small amounts of an element. Spectroscopy\n is the process of analyzing the light produced when an element is heated.\n The light pattern, or spectrum, produced is different for every element.\n The spectrum (plural: spectra) consists of a series of very specific\n colored lines. In 1898, Ramsay and Travers were studying the minute amount of gas that\n remained after oxygen, nitrogen, and argon had been removed from air. They\n heated the sample of gas and studied the spectrum produced by it. Ramsay\n and Travers found spectral lines they had never seen before. They\n described their discovery: A computer-generated model of a neon atom. The blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story, and it was a\n sight to dwell upon and never to forget. It was worth the struggle of the\n previous two years; and all the difficulties yet to be overcome before the\n research was finished. The undiscovered gas had come to light in a manner which was no less than dramatic. For the\n moment, the actual spectrum of the gas did not matter in the least, for\n nothing in the world gave a glow such as we had seen. Ramsay's son was one of the first people to hear about the\n discovery. He wanted to name the new element novum, meaning \"new.\" His father liked the idea, but suggested\n using the Greek word for \"new,\" neos. Thus, the element was named neon. \"The blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story, and\n it was a sight to dwell upon and never to forget.' Physical properties Neon is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It changes from a gas to a\n liquid at -245.92°C (-410.66°F) and from a liquid to a solid at\n -248.6°C (-415.5°F). Its density is 0.89994 grams A man bends a glass tube that will be used for neon lighting . The\n completed, glowing tubes are in the background. per liter. By comparison, the density of air is about 1.29 grams per\n liter. Chemical properties Neon is chemically inactive. So far, it has been impossible to make neon\n react with any other element or compound. Occurrence in nature and Extraction The abundance of neon in normal air is 18.2 parts per million (0.0182\n percent). Isotopes Three isotopes of neon exist, neon-20, neon-21, and neon-22. Isotopes are\n two or more forms of an element. Isotopes differ from each other according\n to their mass number. The number written to the right of the\n element's name is the mass number. The mass number represents the\n number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus of an atom of the element.\n The number of protons determines the element, but the number of neutrons\n in the atom of any one element can vary. Each variation is an isotope. Three radioactive isotopes of neon are known also. A radioactive isotope\n is one that breaks apart and gives off some form The neon lights of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the early 1990s. of radiation. Radioactive isotopes are produced when very small particles\n are fired at atoms. These particles stick in the atoms and make them\n radioactive. None of the radioactive isotopes of neon has any commercial application. Extraction Neon can be obtained from air by fractional distillation. The first step\n in fractional distillation of air is to change a container of air to a\n liquid. The liquid air is then allowed to warm up. As the air warms, each\n element in air changes from a liquid back to a gas at a different\n temperature. The portion of air that changes back to a gas at\n -245.92°C is neon. Uses The best known use of neon gas is in neon lights. A neon light consists of\n a glass tube filled with neon or some other inert gas. An electric current\n is passed through the tube. The electric current causes neon atoms to\n break apart. After a fraction of a second, the parts recombine. When they\n recombine, they give off neon light. The light produced is the light given\n off by the neon light. Neon lighting was invented by French chemist Georges Claude (1870-1960).\n Claude displayed his first neon sign at the Paris Exposition of 1910. He\n sold the first neon advertising sign to a Paris barber two years later. By the 1920s, neon lighting had become popular in many parts of the world.\n Neon lights were fairly inexpensive, lasted a long time, and were very\n attractive. Probably the most spectacular collection of neon lighting is\n in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hotels, night clubs, and restaurants seem to try to\n outdo everyone else in having the biggest and brightest neon sign. Neon lighting is now used for many other purposes. For example, neon tubes are used in instruments used to detect electric currents. Neon is also\n used in the manufacture of lasers. A laser is a device for producing very\n bright light of a single color. Lasers now have many uses in industry and\n medicine. They are very efficient at cutting metal and plastic. They can\n also be used to do very precise kinds of surgery. Compounds There are no compounds of neon. The first neon advertising sign was used by a Paris barber in 1912.

Other elements in this family\n includes helium, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon. These gases are in Group 18 (VIIIA) of the periodic table. The periodic\n table is a chart that shows how chemical elements are related to each\n other. The noble gases are sometimes called the inert gases. This name\n comes from the fact that these elements do not react very readily. In\n fact, compounds exist for only three noble gases—krypton, radon,\n and xenon. Chemists have yet to prepare compounds of helium, neon, or argon . Neon was discovered in 1898 by British chemists William Ramsay (1852-1916)\n and Morris Travers (1872-1961). It occurs naturally in the atmosphere, but\n only in very small amounts. SYMBOL Ne ATOMIC NUMBER 10 ATOMIC MASS 20.179 FAMILY Group 18 (VIIIA) Noble gas PRONUNCIATION NEE-on Neon has relatively few uses. The most familiar is neon lighting . Today,\n neon signs of every color, shape, and size exist. Neon signs are often\n filled with neon gas, but they may also contain other gases as well. The\n gas contained in the sign tube determines the color of light given off.\n The color given off by neon itself is reddish-orange. Discovery and naming It took humans centuries to understand air. At one time, philosophers\n thought air was an element. Among the ancient Greeks, for example, the\n four bask elements were air, fire, water, and earth. The first research to disprove that idea was done in the 1770s. In that\n decade, two new elements were discovered in air: nitrogen and oxygen. For some time, chemists were convinced that these two gases were the only\n ones present in air. That idea is easy to understand. Between them, nitrogen and oxygen make up more than 99 percent of air. But over time, chemists became more skilled at making measurements. They\n recognized that something else was in air besides nitrogen and oxygen.\n That \"something else\" accounted for the remaining one\n percent that is not nitrogen or oxygen. In 1894, a third element was\n discovered in air: argon. Argon makes up about 0.934 percent of air. So,\n nitrogen, oxygen, and argon together make up about 99.966 percent of air. But what was responsible for the remaining 0.034 percent of air? Chemists\n knew that other gases must be present in very small amounts. But what were\n those gases? That question was answered between 1895 and 1900. Five more inert gases\n were discovered in air. One of those was neon.

Whether for business strategy or technological advancement, these techniques help us improve our decision-making and future planning. But for that to happen, our models must first have high accuracy. That’s why loss functions are perhaps the most essential part of training your model because they show the accuracy of its performance—especially the cross-entropy loss function. Aside from cross-entropy loss, there are different types of loss functions, such as L2-norm loss. It’s not, however, a one-size-fits-all situation because not all functions will be compatible with your model. Choosing the right one is vital for training.  This article addresses the cross-entropy loss function. We’ll explain what it is, outline the subtypes, and provide a practical example to better understand the fundamentals. Table of Contents What Is Cross-Entropy Loss? Types of Cross-Entropy Loss Function How to Apply the Cross-Entropy Loss Function: A Practical Example Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Next Steps What Is Cross-Entropy Loss? Cross-entropy loss refers to the contrast between two random variables. It measures the variables to extract the difference in the information they contain, showcasing the results. Before going into detail, however, let’s briefly discuss loss functions. We separate them into two categories based on their outputs: Regression loss functions Classification loss functions Regression and classification are the two categories that make up the principle of supervised learning . And, while the outputs in regression tasks, for example, are numbers, the outputs for classification are categories, like cats and dogs. We use cross-entropy loss in classification tasks to calculate how accurate our machine learning or deep learning model is by defining the difference between the estimated probability with our desired outcome; it’s the most popular loss function in such cases. The cross-entropy loss function measures your model’s performance by transforming its variables into real numbers, thereby evaluating the ’loss’ associated with them. The higher the difference between the two, the higher the loss. We define the cross-entropy loss formula in the following way: Cross-Entropy = L ( y , t ) = − ∑ i t i ln y i Cross-Entropy = L ( y , t ) = − ∑ i t i ln ⁡ y i Types of Cross-Entropy Loss Function We recognize two primary types of the cross-entropy loss function in machine learning and deep learning classification tasks, namely: Binary cross-entropy loss Categorical cross-entropy loss Let’s discover what each loss function entails. Binary Cross-Entropy Loss Binary cross-entropy loss is used in binary classification tasks, with only two possible classes or labels: positive and negative or true and false. This type of cross-entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels. It encourages the model to output higher probabilities for the positive class and lower probabilities for the negative class. We calculate the binary cross-entropy loss function with the following formula: L = 1 N N ∑ i = 1 ( y i log ( p i ) + ( 1 − y i ) log ( 1 − p i ) ) L = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y i log ⁡ ( p i ) + ( 1 − y i ) log ⁡ ( 1 − p i ) ) The binary cross-entropy loss is commonly used in neural networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer. It trains models to successfully distinguish two classes by minimizing the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true labels. Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss We utilize categorical cross-entropy loss in multi-class classification tasks with more than two mutually exclusive classes. Similarly to the binary, this type of cross-entropy loss function quantifies the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true categorical labels. And here’s how we represent the categorical cross-entropy loss formula: L = − 1 N N ∑ i = 1 = C ∑ j = 1 = y i j l o g ( p i j ) L = − 1 N ∑ i = 1 N = ∑ j = 1 C = y i j l o g ( p i j ) The categorical cross-entropy loss function is commonly used in neural networks with softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks. By minimizing loss, the model learns to assign higher probabilities to the correct class while reducing the probabilities for incorrect classes, improving accuracy. How to Apply the Cross-Entropy Loss Function: А Practical Example Now that you know what cross-entropy loss function is, let’s learn how it works and how to apply it in practice. We’ll illustrate this through a practical classification example. Let’s consider three categories: Cats Dogs Horses These are all labeled images, with the label as the target. But how does it look in numerical terms? The target vector t for this photo would be 0,1,0: The 0s mean it is not a cat or a horse, while the 0 shows it is, indeed, a dog. If we were to examine a picture of a horse, the target vector will be 0,0,1: Imagine the outputs of our model for these two images are 0.4, 0.4, 0.2 for the first image and 0.1, 0.2, 0.7 for the second: After some machine learning transformations, these vectors show the probabilities for each photo: a cat, dog, or horse. The first vector shows that—according to our algorithm—there is a 0.4 (or 40%) chance that the first photo is a cat. Additionally, there’s a 40% chance the photo is of a dog and 20% a horse. What about the cross-entropy loss function of each photo? Let’s observe. The loss for the first image would be: L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln 0.4 − 1 × ln 0.4 − 0 × ln 0.2 = 0.92 L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.4 − 1 × ln ⁡ 0.4 − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.2 = 0.92 Meanwhile, the cross-entropy loss for the second image is: L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln 0.1 − 0 × ln 0.2 − 1 × ln 0.7 = 0.36 L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.1 − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.2 − 1 × ln ⁡ 0.7 = 0.36 As we already know, the lower the loss function, the more accurate the model. So, what’s the meaning of these two cross-entropies? They show the second loss is lower; therefore, its prediction is superior. For the first image, the model was unsure if the photo was of a dog or a cat—there was an equal 40% probability for both options. We can oppose this to the second photo, where the model was 70% sure it was a horse, so the cross-entropy was lower. An important note is that, with classification, our target vectors consist of 0s and a 1, which indicates the correct category. Therefore, we could simplify the above formulas to minus the log of the probability of the output for the correct answer. Note an illustration of how our initial formulas would change: For the image of the dog, we would have: L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.4 L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.4 Meanwhile, the horse image would become: L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.7 L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.7 Cross-Entropy Loss Function FAQs Is cross-entropy loss a loss function? Yes, cross-entropy loss is a loss function used in classification tasks when training a supervised learning algorithm. It’s the most popular loss function for machine learning or deep learning classification. This loss function is typically found in linear classification models like the logistic regression algorithm. We divide the cross-entropy loss function into two subtypes based on what tasks we need it to complete: • Binary cross-entropy function—used in neural networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer • Categorical cross-entropy function—used in neural networks with softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks Why choose the cross-entropy loss function? You should choose the popular cross-entropy loss function because it’s easy to implement. You can optimize your algorithms more efficiently. The loss function measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true labels and encourages probabilistic predictions, enabling nuanced outputs and reflecting the model's confidence. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss handles class imbalance in a model by adjusting the weights or assigning importance to underrepresented classes. And finally, its two subtypes (binary and categorical) are compatible with neural network activation functions like the sigmoid and softmax, which enhances its ability to interpret class probability. Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Next Steps Unsurprisingly, cross-entropy loss is the most popular function used in machine learning or deep learning classification. After all, it helps determine the accuracy of a model in numerical values of 0s and 1s, from which we can later extract the probability percentage. As mentioned, other loss functions can help us resolve a problem. We must emphasize that any function with the fundamental property of being higher for worse results and lower for better results can be a loss function. Loss functions are essential because they help us improve the accuracy of our models significantly.

Whether for business strategy or technological advancement, these techniques help us improve our decision-making and future planning. But for that to happen, our models must first have high accuracy. That’s why loss functions are perhaps the most essential part of training your model because they show the accuracy of its performance—especially the cross-entropy loss function. Aside from cross-entropy loss, there are different types of loss functions, such as L2-norm loss. It’s not, however, a one-size-fits-all situation because not all functions will be compatible with your model. Choosing the right one is vital for training.  This article addresses the cross-entropy loss function. We’ll explain what it is, outline the subtypes, and provide a practical example to better understand the fundamentals. Table of Contents What Is Cross-Entropy Loss? Types of Cross-Entropy Loss Function How to Apply the Cross-Entropy Loss Function: A Practical Example Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Next Steps What Is Cross-Entropy Loss? Cross-entropy loss refers to the contrast between two random variables. It measures the variables to extract the difference in the information they contain, showcasing the results. Before going into detail, however, let’s briefly discuss loss functions. We separate them into two categories based on their outputs: Regression loss functions Classification loss functions Regression and classification are the two categories that make up the principle of supervised learning . And, while the outputs in regression tasks, for example, are numbers, the outputs for classification are categories, like cats and dogs. We use cross-entropy loss in classification tasks to calculate how accurate our machine learning or deep learning model is by defining the difference between the estimated probability with our desired outcome; it’s the most popular loss function in such cases. The cross-entropy loss function measures your model’s performance by transforming its variables into real numbers, thereby evaluating the ’loss’ associated with them. The higher the difference between the two, the higher the loss. We define the cross-entropy loss formula in the following way: Cross-Entropy = L ( y , t ) = − ∑ i t i ln y i Cross-Entropy = L ( y , t ) = − ∑ i t i ln ⁡ y i Types of Cross-Entropy Loss Function We recognize two primary types of the cross-entropy loss function in machine learning and deep learning classification tasks, namely: Binary cross-entropy loss Categorical cross-entropy loss Let’s discover what each loss function entails. Binary Cross-Entropy Loss Binary cross-entropy loss is used in binary classification tasks, with only two possible classes or labels: positive and negative or true and false. This type of cross-entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels. It encourages the model to output higher probabilities for the positive class and lower probabilities for the negative class. We calculate the binary cross-entropy loss function with the following formula: L = 1 N N ∑ i = 1 ( y i log ( p i ) + ( 1 − y i ) log ( 1 − p i ) ) L = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( y i log ⁡ ( p i ) + ( 1 − y i ) log ⁡ ( 1 − p i ) ) The binary cross-entropy loss is commonly used in neural networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer. It trains models to successfully distinguish two classes by minimizing the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true labels. Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss We utilize categorical cross-entropy loss in multi-class classification tasks with more than two mutually exclusive classes. Similarly to the binary, this type of cross-entropy loss function quantifies the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true categorical labels. And here’s how we represent the categorical cross-entropy loss formula: L = − 1 N N ∑ i = 1 = C ∑ j = 1 = y i j l o g ( p i j ) L = − 1 N ∑ i = 1 N = ∑ j = 1 C = y i j l o g ( p i j ) The categorical cross-entropy loss function is commonly used in neural networks with softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks. By minimizing loss, the model learns to assign higher probabilities to the correct class while reducing the probabilities for incorrect classes, improving accuracy. How to Apply the Cross-Entropy Loss Function: А Practical Example Now that you know what cross-entropy loss function is, let’s learn how it works and how to apply it in practice. We’ll illustrate this through a practical classification example. Let’s consider three categories: Cats Dogs Horses These are all labeled images, with the label as the target. But how does it look in numerical terms? The target vector t for this photo would be 0,1,0: The 0s mean it is not a cat or a horse, while the 0 shows it is, indeed, a dog. If we were to examine a picture of a horse, the target vector will be 0,0,1: Imagine the outputs of our model for these two images are 0.4, 0.4, 0.2 for the first image and 0.1, 0.2, 0.7 for the second: After some machine learning transformations, these vectors show the probabilities for each photo: a cat, dog, or horse. The first vector shows that—according to our algorithm—there is a 0.4 (or 40%) chance that the first photo is a cat. Additionally, there’s a 40% chance the photo is of a dog and 20% a horse. What about the cross-entropy loss function of each photo? Let’s observe. The loss for the first image would be: L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln 0.4 − 1 × ln 0.4 − 0 × ln 0.2 = 0.92 L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.4 − 1 × ln ⁡ 0.4 − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.2 = 0.92 Meanwhile, the cross-entropy loss for the second image is: L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln 0.1 − 0 × ln 0.2 − 1 × ln 0.7 = 0.36 L ( y , t ) = − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.1 − 0 × ln ⁡ 0.2 − 1 × ln ⁡ 0.7 = 0.36 As we already know, the lower the loss function, the more accurate the model. So, what’s the meaning of these two cross-entropies? They show the second loss is lower; therefore, its prediction is superior. For the first image, the model was unsure if the photo was of a dog or a cat—there was an equal 40% probability for both options. We can oppose this to the second photo, where the model was 70% sure it was a horse, so the cross-entropy was lower. An important note is that, with classification, our target vectors consist of 0s and a 1, which indicates the correct category. Therefore, we could simplify the above formulas to minus the log of the probability of the output for the correct answer. Note an illustration of how our initial formulas would change: For the image of the dog, we would have: L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.4 L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.4 Meanwhile, the horse image would become: L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.7 L ( y , t ) = − 1 × l n 0.7 Cross-Entropy Loss Function FAQs Is cross-entropy loss a loss function? Yes, cross-entropy loss is a loss function used in classification tasks when training a supervised learning algorithm. It’s the most popular loss function for machine learning or deep learning classification. This loss function is typically found in linear classification models like the logistic regression algorithm. We divide the cross-entropy loss function into two subtypes based on what tasks we need it to complete: • Binary cross-entropy function—used in neural networks with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer • Categorical cross-entropy function—used in neural networks with softmax activation in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks Why choose the cross-entropy loss function? You should choose the popular cross-entropy loss function because it’s easy to implement. You can optimize your algorithms more efficiently. The loss function measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true labels and encourages probabilistic predictions, enabling nuanced outputs and reflecting the model's confidence. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss handles class imbalance in a model by adjusting the weights or assigning importance to underrepresented classes. And finally, its two subtypes (binary and categorical) are compatible with neural network activation functions like the sigmoid and softmax, which enhances its ability to interpret class probability. Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Next Steps Unsurprisingly, cross-entropy loss is the most popular function used in machine learning or deep learning classification. After all, it helps determine the accuracy of a model in numerical values of 0s and 1s, from which we can later extract the probability percentage. As mentioned, other loss functions can help us resolve a problem. We must emphasize that any function with the fundamental property of being higher for worse results and lower for better results can be a loss function. Loss functions are essential because they help us improve the accuracy of our models significantly. If you want a better understanding of the cross-entropy loss function and other types, we can help you on your machine learning and deep learning journey.

Charged particles move in circles at a constant speed if projected into a magnetic field at right angles to the field. Charged particles move in straight lines at a constant speed if projected into a magnetic field along the direction of the field. Figure 2 shows a 3D diagram of and electron moving at right angles \nto a uniform magnetic field.

Path of an electron in an electric field We will consider next the case of an electron entering a uniform electroc \nfield between two parallel plates (Figure 4). The potential difference between the plates is V \nand the plates are aligned along the x direction and the electron enters the field at right \nangles to the field lines: The force on the electron is given by the equation: F = \neE = eV/d = ma But since there \nis a force the electron must accelerate in the y direction and the acceleration is given by a = \n2y/t 2 . (From the equation s = y = ut + ½ at 2 ) Therefore if we combine these to equations F = m2s/t 2 and at right angles to then field x = vt so the \nequation for the path of the electron is: eV/d = m2y/t 2 = 2myv 2 /x 2 or: Electron path:   y = [eV/2dmv 2 ]x 2 this is the equation of a parabola since for a given electron velocity y is \nproportional to x 2 .\n\nNotice that if the electron is moving at right angles to the field \nthen the path in the field is independent of the distance of the original direction from either \nplate. Charged particles move in parabolas if projected into an electric field in a direction at right angles to the field. Charged particles move in straight lines and accelerate (or decelerate) if projected into an electric field along the direction of the field. In an electric field the \nelectron moves at a constant velocity at right angles to the field but accelerates along the \ndirection of the field. Example problem An electron is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 5000 V and then enters a magnetic field of strength 0.02 T acting at right angles to its path. Calculate the radius of the resulting electron orbit. Bev = mv 2 /r so r = mv/Be = 9.1x10 -31 x4.2x10 7 /0.02x1.6x10 -19 = 1.2 x10 -2 m = 1.2 cm. As the electrons orbit they accelerate and so lose energy by radiation and therefore slow down and \ntheir orbit decreases. It must be remembered that the electric force acts along the \nline of the electric field direction while the magnetic force acts at right angles to the field \ndirection.

In our guide, we’ll briefly go over the basics of gas chromatography and how it works before examining some of the most common applications for gas chromatography. What Is Gas Chromatography? First, we’ll briefly explain what gas chromatography is and how it works. Gas chromatography is a method of analytical technique for separating, detecting, and quantifying the chemical components of a sample mixture. Gas chromatography requires volatile components in the compounds to work and can work on gas, liquid, or even solid samples. Naturally, many industries need to accurately identify the chemical components of products for analysis or quality control, which is why it’s such a popular method in so many applications. How Does Gas Chromatography Work? The gas chromatography process is a rather simple and quick process that includes gas chromatography equipment like an autosampler, gas chromatograph, analytical column, detector, and chromatogram. First, the sample is introduced into the gas chromatograph (either as a gas or vaporized into one), and a carrier gas transports the molecules through the system. Upon entering the analytical column, the sample is heated to separate the volatile components from the sample and carrier gas. The column is then inserted into the detector, which analyzes the eluting chemical components and produces a signal recorded on a computer to produce a chromatogram. Advantages of Gas Chromatography Gas chromatography is a favored method by many chemists and researchers across numerous applications and settings—but why is it so popular? Gas chromatography offers many advantages, including speed, versatility, and accuracy. Speed of Analysis One of the prime benefits gas chromatography provides to researchers is its convenience due to the speed of its analysis. The parameters of the gas chromatography operation can be quickly changed and adjusted, so the sample analysis is quick but still effective. The gas chromatography process can be completed within minutes, much faster than other chemical compound identification and quantification methods. In many industries where time is valuable, gas chromatography is the ideal method for quality control. Sample Options One of the reasons that gas chromatography is widely used in various settings and industries is its versatility in analyzing sample types. Gas chromatography can analyze liquid, gas, and even dissolved solids samples—something many other methods like thin layer chromatography (TLC) can’t offer. This versatility is because gas chromatography allows users to control the temperature throughout the process. This control allows scientists to analyze samples with boiling points of 400 degrees accurately. Accurate Quantification Identifying and quantifying the chemical compounds in a sample is quite challenging, but gas chromatography is one of the few methods capable of providing accurate data for quantitative estimations. Other methods, like TLC, require additional equipment and accessories like densitometers to provide accurate quantification results. With gas chromatography, scientists get accurate results without spending additional equipment. Another reason gas chromatography is favored in so many industries because it is accurate and cost-efficient. Sensitive Analysis Of course, an analysis process’s benefits are moot if it doesn’t offer accurate and sensitive results. Gas chromatography offers a wide range of detectors for flame ionization, nitrogen phosphorous, and many more applications. These detectors give gas chromatography more sensitive detection for specific compounds, making it more capable of accurately detecting components like nitrogen and halogens. With the detectors, gas chromatography can still offer accurate quantification data with lower limits than other methods. Applications for Gas Chromatography Gas chromatography offers many advantages, but what is it primarily used for? As we’ve said, gas chromatography’s versatility makes it a favorite across many industries and applications, from food testing to meteorite analysis. Food Analysis Food analysis and quality control are one of the most common applications for gas chromatography due to their component quantification, accuracy, and speedy process. Gas chromatography is used in the food industry both for quality control and for accurate quantification of compounds and contaminants in food, such as: Carbohydrates Proteins Vitamins Lips Steroids Pesticides Trace elements With gas chromatography, food producers can accurately quantify the elements in their food, and the FDA ensures that it’s of sufficient quality and safety. Thanks to gas chromatography, consumers can purchase food at a grocery store with confidence that it’s been thoroughly tested for safety and that the food labels are accurate. Environmental Monitoring Gas chromatography is also a popular method for ensuring that the air and water we breathe are safe for consumption. A huge industry of scientists study our environment, and gas chromatography is a favored technique for detecting contaminants in the environment—particularly those in the air. With gas chromatography, researchers can accurately determine the quality of the air and identify potentially harmful chemicals in the air and where they might come from. Environmental regulators and organizations like the EPA commonly use gas chromatography to ensure air and water sources aren’t contaminated. Drug Testing Gas chromatography is also useful in identifying chemical compounds within the human body through the analysis of bodily fluids. Gas chromatography is a quick and accurate drug testing method, which makes it a favored technique for things like law enforcement; in fact, it’s been used to detect blood alcohol levels since the ‘50s. Gas chromatography can accurately identify and quantify alcohol or drug use in athletes. Sporting bodies like the Olympics and professional leagues commonly use gas chromatography to test athletes for traces of banned substances. Forensics Gas chromatography provides the capable identification of compounds in bodily fluids, so it’s also a favored method in forensic analysis. Many forensic analysts use gas chromatography to determine a person’s death by concluding whether they were poisoned, intoxicated, or overdosed on a banned substance. With gas chromatography, forensic analysts can more accurately determine the circumstances of a person’s death and provide that information to law enforcement. Manufacturing Quality Control Another industry where gas chromatography is common in manufacturing. From automotive plants to pharmaceuticals, many manufacturers use gas chromatography to test the quality and safety of their products. Pharmaceuticals must test the purity of the compounds within their drugs to ensure every batch is safe for consumption. Automotive plants use gas chromatography to ensure there is no harmful chemicals leftover from the manufacturing process that can harm humans within the vehicle. Environmental Research As we mentioned, environmental researchers use gas chromatography often, but it’s also favored by scientists examining things from outside our world. Gas chromatography has even been commonly used to analyze and research meteorites that have fallen to earth. With gas chromatography, scientists can accurately identify and quantify chemicals within objects from space, deepening our understanding beyond our planet.

The gas chromatography process can be completed within minutes, much faster than other chemical compound identification and quantification methods. In many industries where time is valuable, gas chromatography is the ideal method for quality control. Sample Options One of the reasons that gas chromatography is widely used in various settings and industries is its versatility in analyzing sample types. Gas chromatography can analyze liquid, gas, and even dissolved solids samples—something many other methods like thin layer chromatography (TLC) can’t offer. This versatility is because gas chromatography allows users to control the temperature throughout the process. This control allows scientists to analyze samples with boiling points of 400 degrees accurately. Accurate Quantification Identifying and quantifying the chemical compounds in a sample is quite challenging, but gas chromatography is one of the few methods capable of providing accurate data for quantitative estimations. Other methods, like TLC, require additional equipment and accessories like densitometers to provide accurate quantification results. With gas chromatography, scientists get accurate results without spending additional equipment. Another reason gas chromatography is favored in so many industries because it is accurate and cost-efficient. Sensitive Analysis Of course, an analysis process’s benefits are moot if it doesn’t offer accurate and sensitive results. Gas chromatography offers a wide range of detectors for flame ionization, nitrogen phosphorous, and many more applications. These detectors give gas chromatography more sensitive detection for specific compounds, making it more capable of accurately detecting components like nitrogen and halogens. With the detectors, gas chromatography can still offer accurate quantification data with lower limits than other methods. Applications for Gas Chromatography Gas chromatography offers many advantages, but what is it primarily used for? As we’ve said, gas chromatography’s versatility makes it a favorite across many industries and applications, from food testing to meteorite analysis. Food Analysis Food analysis and quality control are one of the most common applications for gas chromatography due to their component quantification, accuracy, and speedy process. Gas chromatography is used in the food industry both for quality control and for accurate quantification of compounds and contaminants in food, such as: Carbohydrates Proteins Vitamins Lips Steroids Pesticides Trace elements With gas chromatography, food producers can accurately quantify the elements in their food, and the FDA ensures that it’s of sufficient quality and safety. Thanks to gas chromatography, consumers can purchase food at a grocery store with confidence that it’s been thoroughly tested for safety and that the food labels are accurate. Environmental Monitoring Gas chromatography is also a popular method for ensuring that the air and water we breathe are safe for consumption. A huge industry of scientists study our environment, and gas chromatography is a favored technique for detecting contaminants in the environment—particularly those in the air. With gas chromatography, researchers can accurately determine the quality of the air and identify potentially harmful chemicals in the air and where they might come from. Environmental regulators and organizations like the EPA commonly use gas chromatography to ensure air and water sources aren’t contaminated. Drug Testing Gas chromatography is also useful in identifying chemical compounds within the human body through the analysis of bodily fluids. Gas chromatography is a quick and accurate drug testing method, which makes it a favored technique for things like law enforcement; in fact, it’s been used to detect blood alcohol levels since the ‘50s. Gas chromatography can accurately identify and quantify alcohol or drug use in athletes. Sporting bodies like the Olympics and professional leagues commonly use gas chromatography to test athletes for traces of banned substances. Forensics Gas chromatography provides the capable identification of compounds in bodily fluids, so it’s also a favored method in forensic analysis. Many forensic analysts use gas chromatography to determine a person’s death by concluding whether they were poisoned, intoxicated, or overdosed on a banned substance. With gas chromatography, forensic analysts can more accurately determine the circumstances of a person’s death and provide that information to law enforcement. Manufacturing Quality Control Another industry where gas chromatography is common in manufacturing. From automotive plants to pharmaceuticals, many manufacturers use gas chromatography to test the quality and safety of their products. Pharmaceuticals must test the purity of the compounds within their drugs to ensure every batch is safe for consumption. Automotive plants use gas chromatography to ensure there is no harmful chemicals leftover from the manufacturing process that can harm humans within the vehicle. Environmental Research As we mentioned, environmental researchers use gas chromatography often, but it’s also favored by scientists examining things from outside our world. Gas chromatography has even been commonly used to analyze and research meteorites that have fallen to earth. With gas chromatography, scientists can accurately identify and quantify chemicals within objects from space, deepening our understanding beyond our planet.

What Elutes First in Column Chromatography? In column chromatography, the compounds that interact least with the stationary phase (and are most soluble in the mobile phase) elute first. General Rule: Less polar compounds elute first when using a polar stationary phase (like silica gel), which is the most common setup. Why? The stationary phase (e.g., silica gel or alumina) is polar, so it retains polar compounds more strongly. Non-polar compounds have weaker interactions with the stationary phase and move faster with the non-polar solvent, eluting first. Example (with Silica Gel and Hexane/Ethyl Acetate as solvent): Compound Polarity Elution Order Hexane (very non-polar) Low 1st Benzene Low–Moderate 2nd Acetophenone Moderate 3rd Benzoic acid (polar) High Last In Summary: Non-polar compounds elute first. Polar compounds elute later due to stronger binding with the stationary phase. The solvent system (polarity of mobile phase) also influences the elution order—more polar solvents can help elute polar compounds faster. In general, compounds that interact less strongly with the stationary phase elute first from the column. Adsorption: In adsorption chromatography, such as using silica gel or alumina as the stationary phase, compounds with lower polarity are more easily carried away by the mobile phase, so compounds with lower polarity elute first. Ion exchange chromatography: In ion exchange chromatography, compounds with lower charges (such as weakly negatively charged or neutral molecules) elute first, while compounds with higher charges (such as strongly negatively charged molecules) are retained longer by the stationary phase. Hydrophobic interaction: In hydrophobic interaction chromatography, molecules with a lower hydrophobic match with the stationary phase (such as more hydrophilic molecules) elute faster. Other factors: The shape and size of the compound, as well as the nature of the mobile phase, also affect the elution order. For example, spherical molecules may elute earlier than linear molecules. Compounds that elute first in column chromatography are usually those that interact less strongly with the stationary phase. The specific order needs to be determined based on the experimental conditions (such as the choice of mobile phase, stationary phase type, and sample composition). nth6x 2025-04-16T06:44:24+00:00 April 16th, 2025 | Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

Synopsis Hurricane Irma formed from an African Easterly Wave, more commonly known as tropical waves. It became a tropical storm on August 30 th about 420 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands in the far eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, and quickly attained hurricane status on August 31st while still in the far eastern Atlantic about 650 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Irma continued to gradually strengthen over the next several days as it tracked generally westward across the tropical Atlantic. By the time Hurricane Irma struck Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands around 2am on Wednesday, September 6 th , it was a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph winds.  Five hours later, the eye of Irma moved over St. Martin, still with 185 mph winds, while the northern eyewall pounded Anguilla.  That afternoon, Irma cut a path directly through the British Virgin Islands.  After the southern eyewall raked St. Thomas, Puerto Rico was largely spared as the center passed about 45 miles north of San Juan.  Hurricane conditions did occur on Puerto Rico’s northeastern coast.  Still a Category 5, Irma impacted portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.  From Friday evening September 8 th through Saturday afternoon September 9 th , Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba.  Interaction with land caused Irma to weaken from a Category 5 to a Category 3 before it began to pull away from the northern coast of Cuba late Saturday afternoon. On Sunday morning, September 10 th , Irma strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it accelerated toward the Florida Keys.  The eye made landfall in Cudjoe Key as a 130 mph Category 4 at 9:10am.  The center of Irma then made landfall in Marco Island at 3:35pm that afternoon as a Category 3 with 115 mph winds.  The center moved into central Florida overnight and into northern Florida later on Monday as it weakened. Hurricane Irma's track through Florida The numbers correspond to the date where the eye was located at 8 AM EDT each day Watches and Warnings for Southern Florida The following watches and warnings were valid for all or parts of the following counties in southern Florida: Broward, Collier, Glades, Hendry, Mainland Monroe, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. All times EDT. Issued Expired Hurricane Watch 11 AM Sept 7th Upgraded to Warning at 11 PM Sept 7th Storm Surge Watch 11 AM Sept 7th Upgraded to Warning at 11 PM Sept 7th Hurricane Warning 11 PM Sept 7th Downgraded to TS Warning 11 PM Sept 10th Storm Surge Warning (Broward & Palm Beach) 11 PM Sept 7th 11 PM Sept 10th Storm Surge Warning (Miami-Dade) 11 PM Sept 7th 5 AM Sept 11th Storm Surge Warning (Collier & Mainland Monroe) 11 PM Sept 7th 11 AM Sept 11th Tropical Storm Warning 11 PM Sept 10th 5 AM Sept 11th Flood Watch 538 PM Sept 8th 544 AM Sept 11th Flash Flood Watch (Lake Okeechobee/Hoover Dike) 1222 PM Sept 8th 1119 AM Sept 11th Tornado Watch 1210 AM Sept 9th 1150 AM Sept 10th The Story for South Floridians South Floridians began paying very close attention to Irma’s forecast up to a week or more prior to landfall in South Florida.  From about 5 days before landfall onward, the NHC forecast was consistent on a threat to South Florida.  Residents and visitors swarmed grocery stores, gas stations and department stores to stock up on essential supplies. The good news was that most South Floridians took the threat from Irma seriously.  The bad news was that grocery stores quickly ran out of food and water, while most gas stations had run out of fuel 1 to 2 days before Irma hit. Many South Floridians joined those across the state in evacuating, becoming a large part of the estimated 6+ million people who were ordered to evacuate, plus those who decided to leave town despite not being in mandatory evacuation zones. Those who left early still encountered significant traffic jams upstate. Finding gas was challenging for many. Upon driving home after the storm, people realized that many roads had either heavy traffic or flooding, which lengthened travel time.  Other South Floridians stayed for the hurricane. Some left the barrier islands to ride out the storm with relatives or friends in a non-evacuation zone. Heavy tree and fence damage was widespread. As a result, over three-quarters of electrical service customers in South Florida lost power, many for close to a week. For east coast metro areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, about 95% of the power was restored within 1 week after the hurricane.  In the western half of South Florida, including Collier, Hendry and Glades counties, over 90% of customers lost power and for periods of over a week. Heaviest damage occurred in these western areas where some structural damage was noted, along with flooding damage from storm surge and rainfall.  In Southeast Florida, structural damage was minor and mostly consisted of roof covering material and screened patios. While Irma's impacts in South Florida were significant, there is no doubt that a slightly stronger Irma and/or a slightly different path could have resulted in much more damage and loss of life and property. Hurricane Irma Infrared Satellite Loop From September 10th, 2017 Hurricane Irma Radar Image Loop from Miami WSR 88-D on September 10th, 2017 Storm Surge/Tide Collier County: the maximum surveyed inundation value was 8 feet at the Smallwood Store in Chokoloskee, with 3-5 feet across most of the island. In Everglades City, a maximum inundation of 6 feet occurred at the Everglades National Park Gulf Visitor Center, with 2-4 feet common across the town and as high as 5 feet in a few areas. Surveys conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) indicated 1-2 feet of inundation as far inland as Tamiami Trail/US 41 between State Road 29 and Collier-Seminole State Park. in Goodland, about 5-6 feet of inundation was surveyed at the waterfront, with inundation of 3-4 feet across town. Marco Island had 2-4 feet of inundation, mainly on the south and east parts of the island with inland penetration of less than a half-mile. Naples had 3-4 feet of inundation at the Gulf of America and Naples Bay waterfronts and extending less than a half-mile inland. Data from a USGS rapid deployment tide gauge at the Tamiami Trail bridge over Naples Bay (image below) showed a rapid rise of 8 feet in just over 9 hours mainly on the back side of Irma during the afternoon and evening of September 10th. This rise would have likely been much greater and devastating had the center of Irma tracked just a few miles farther west. Miami-Dade County : an average of 3-5 feet of inundation occurred along the Biscayne Bay shoreline from Homestead to Downtown Miami/Brickell and extending inland 1-2 blocks, with peak surveyed inundation of slightly greater than 6 feet in isolated spots in Coconut Grove and Brickell. Inundation decreased north of Downtown Miami along the Biscayne Bay shoreline, with values generally around 2-3 feet. Along the Atlantic oceanfront, including Key Biscayne and Miami Beach, inundation was generally around 2-3 feet and confined to the immediate beachfront. Broward and Palm Beach Counties : maximum inundation of slightly greater than 3 feet along the Broward County coastline from Hallandale Beach to Fort Lauderdale, confined to the beachfront with lesser inundation affecting adjacent streets within 1-2 blocks of the beach. North of Fort Lauderdale through the Palm Beaches, inundation was generally 1-2 feet at the beachfront. Observed storm tide inundation values. Squares represent locations with measurements from tide gauges and/or NWS storm surveys Wind Irma was the first major (Category 3 or higher) hurricane to make landfall in South Florida since Wilma of 2005. The highest wind gust recorded on land in South Florida was 142 mph at a mesonet site near Naples Airport. The highest sustained wind recorded was 112 mph by a spotter on Marco Island. The map to the left is an analysis of maximum sustained winds (1-minute average) in Hurricane Irma conducted by NWS Miami.  The analysis is a best estimate based on all available data. The map on the right is from the National Hurricane Center Tropical Cyclone Report on Hurricane Irma (red- hurricane force, orange- 58-73 mph, yellow 39-57 mph). Disclaimer: some locations may have received winds slightly higher or slightly lower than shown, and does NOT include short-duration wind gusts which were at least 20-30 mph higher than the 1-minute average sustained wind speed Collier County: Sustained Category 3 winds of 111-115 mph were likely confined to a very small area of the eye that touched Marco Island and the immediate coastline of Collier County, including Goodland and Cape Romano. Sustained Category 2 winds (96-110 mph) likely extended farther inland into west-central Collier County in the eastern eye wall, including the Golden Gate Estates and Orangetree areas. All of the greater Naples area received hurricane force sustained winds, with Category 2 sustained winds likely affecting much of southern and eastern portions of Naples. Along the northern coast of Collier County to the north of Naples, sustained winds likely peaked at Category 1 strength. Farther to the northeast, Immokalee likely received Category 1 sustained winds. Peak wind gusts in Collier County reached at least Category 2 strength (95-110 mph) over most areas, with peak Category 3 and 4 gusts (111-140 mph) in the eastern eye wall. In addition, storm surveys indicated the likelihood of mini-vortices in the eastern eye wall which led to small swaths of higher winds. Glades and Hendry Counties: Sustained winds of Category 1 strength likely occurred over most of Glades and Hendry counties, with highest winds in the LaBelle and Felda areas. Wind in northeastern Glades County likely peaked at slightly below hurricane force. Peak wind gusts of Category 2 strength (95-110 mph) likely occurred in the LaBelle and Felda areas. Miami-Dade County: Most of the populated areas of Miami-Dade County experienced sustained winds of strong tropical storm force (58-73 mph). However, there were a few areas that likely experienced sustained winds of Category 1 hurricane strength.  Sustained winds may have reached hurricane force (around 75 mph) in portions of southern Key Biscayne. Although not explicitly shown on the map, it is possible that sustained winds briefly reached 75 mph within a mile of Biscayne Bay (east of Bayshore Drive and east of Old Cutler Road) from Coconut Grove to Pinecrest to Palmetto Bay.  However, more likely, sustained winds in that area peaked around 70 mph (just below hurricane force). Sustained winds likely reached the lower limits of Category 1 strength in portions of Homestead, especially southern and western portions of Homestead, including Florida City and southern portions of The Redland.  In coastal Miami-Dade County from Downtown Miami northward, including Miami Beach, North Miami Beach, Little Haiti, North Miami and Aventura, sustained winds likely peaked in the 65-70 mph range.  Sustained winds likely only reached the 55-65 mph for the western and northern parts of the metro area (west of the Palmetto expressway to Krome Avenue) including West Kendall, Doral and Miami Lakes.  Almost all of Miami-Dade County experienced peak wind gusts of Category 1 strength (80-95 mph). Broward County : One hurricane force sustained wind of 76 mph was recorded in Broward County at the Seminole Tribe Headquarters in Hollywood, so Category 1 winds are analyzed to have occurred within 1 mile of that location on our map. Elsewhere, sustained winds peaked in the 65-70 mph range in coastal and metro portions of Broward County. Sustained winds were lower in western areas such as Weston, Tamarac and Coral Springs, where the winds likely peaked in the 55-65 mph range. Gusts in most of Broward County were in the Category 1/2 range (80-100 mph). Only isolated spots had gusts over 100 mph, in the 100-110 mph range. Palm Beach County : Sustained winds peaked in the 55-65 mph range over southern coastal areas and most of central Palm Beach County. Stronger sustained winds - in the 65-70 mph range - were observed along the immediate coastline north of West Palm Beach to Jupiter. Wind gusts reached Category 1 strength (80-90 mph) county-wide. Mainland Monroe County: All of Mainland Monroe County likely received sustained winds that peaked in the Category 1 range (74-95 mph).

These areas received anywhere from 9-15 inches of rain, with estimates of up to 20 inches in the Felda area as well as the Big Cypress National Preserve. Elsewhere, rainfall totals were mainly in the 6-10 inch range. Rainfall amounts produced by Hurricane Irma in South Florida Tornadoes Five tornadoes were confirmed in South Florida in association with Irma – 1 in Miami-Dade County, 3 in Broward County and 1 in Collier County. The tornado in Collier County occurred 2 miles west of Ochopee where wooden power poles were damaged along Tamiami Trail between Ochopee and the SR-29 intersection. It was determined to be an EF-1. The tornado in Miami-Dade County occurred near Homestead Motor Speedway. In Broward County, 2 of the tornadoes were EF-1 and the other was EF-0. One of the EF-1 tornadoes occurred 4 miles west of Miramar along 172 nd avenue between Memorial Hospital and Miramar Regional Park, where sections of trees were ripped apart. The other EF-1 occurred 4 miles WNW of Miramar in the Chapel Trail Neighborhood near NW 196 th Avenue, north of Pines Blvd. There were several trees that were ripped apart in a localized area with some damage to roof tiles and screened patios. The damage pattern suggested rotation. The EF-0 tornado was a brief touchdown near Oakland Park. Damage, casualties and impacts to South Florida Deaths : Hurricane Irma was responsible for 1 direct death in South Florida. An 86 year old man in Broward County died after opening the front door of his home during the hurricane to see what was going on when a gust of wind knocked him to the floor, causing him to hit his head. There were 33 indirect deaths in South Florida which occurred before, during and after the storm, including 14 after the storm due to hyperthermia in a nursing home in Hollywood. Damage : In Collier County, at least 88 structures were destroyed and 1,500 others with major damage. Heavy tree and power pole damage occurred in areas affected by the eye wall, including Port of the Islands, Marco Island, Collier Seminole State Park, Golden Gate, Orangetree and parts of the city of Naples. In Hendry County, 42 homes were destroyed, 131 homes suffered major damage and 451 had minor damage. In Glades County, 33 structures were destroyed, 452 with major damage and 442 with minor damage. In Miami-Dade County, while there were no homes that were completely destroyed, there were 1,585 that had damage; including about 1,000 with significant damage. The majority of damage in the county was to trees and fences, with flooding damage in areas impacted by storm surge along the Biscayne Bay shoreline. Rainfall flooding lingered for at least a week after the storm in portions of Collier, Hendry and Glades counties, causing damage to homes as well as farmland. Monetary losses : Unincorporated Collier County (not including Naples, Marco Island and Everglades City) had $320 million in damage. Over 30,000 insurance claims were filed in Collier County. In Hendry County, over 2,000 insurance claims were filed. In Glades County, 669 insurance claims were filed. 50% of Miami-Dade’s agricultural crops weredamaged, resulting in damages of $245 million. 55,012 insurance claims were filed in Miami-Dade. In Broward, 38,836 insurance claims were filed. Most damage in Broward was primarily to trees and fences. In Palm Beach County, the total damage amount from Irma was reported to be $300 million.

Synopsis Hurricane Irma formed from an African Easterly Wave, more commonly known as tropical waves. It became a tropical storm on August 30 th about 420 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands in the far eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, and quickly attained hurricane status on August 31st while still in the far eastern Atlantic about 650 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Irma continued to gradually strengthen over the next several days as it tracked generally westward across the tropical Atlantic. By the time Hurricane Irma struck Barbuda in the northern Leeward Islands around 2am on Wednesday, September 6 th , it was a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph winds.  Five hours later, the eye of Irma moved over St. Martin, still with 185 mph winds, while the northern eyewall pounded Anguilla.  That afternoon, Irma cut a path directly through the British Virgin Islands.  After the southern eyewall raked St. Thomas, Puerto Rico was largely spared as the center passed about 45 miles north of San Juan.  Hurricane conditions did occur on Puerto Rico’s northeastern coast.  Still a Category 5, Irma impacted portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast Bahamas.  From Friday evening September 8 th through Saturday afternoon September 9 th , Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba.  Interaction with land caused Irma to weaken from a Category 5 to a Category 3 before it began to pull away from the northern coast of Cuba late Saturday afternoon. On Sunday morning, September 10 th , Irma strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it accelerated toward the Florida Keys.  The eye made landfall in Cudjoe Key as a 130 mph Category 4 at 9:10am.  The center of Irma then made landfall in Marco Island at 3:35pm that afternoon as a Category 3 with 115 mph winds.  The center moved into central Florida overnight and into northern Florida later on Monday as it weakened. Hurricane Irma's track through Florida The numbers correspond to the date where the eye was located at 8 AM EDT each day Watches and Warnings for Southern Florida The following watches and warnings were valid for all or parts of the following counties in southern Florida: Broward, Collier, Glades, Hendry, Mainland Monroe, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. All times EDT. Issued Expired Hurricane Watch 11 AM Sept 7th Upgraded to Warning at 11 PM Sept 7th Storm Surge Watch 11 AM Sept 7th Upgraded to Warning at 11 PM Sept 7th Hurricane Warning 11 PM Sept 7th Downgraded to TS Warning 11 PM Sept 10th Storm Surge Warning (Broward & Palm Beach) 11 PM Sept 7th 11 PM Sept 10th Storm Surge Warning (Miami-Dade) 11 PM Sept 7th 5 AM Sept 11th Storm Surge Warning (Collier & Mainland Monroe) 11 PM Sept 7th 11 AM Sept 11th Tropical Storm Warning 11 PM Sept 10th 5 AM Sept 11th Flood Watch 538 PM Sept 8th 544 AM Sept 11th Flash Flood Watch (Lake Okeechobee/Hoover Dike) 1222 PM Sept 8th 1119 AM Sept 11th Tornado Watch 1210 AM Sept 9th 1150 AM Sept 10th The Story for South Floridians South Floridians began paying very close attention to Irma’s forecast up to a week or more prior to landfall in South Florida.  From about 5 days before landfall onward, the NHC forecast was consistent on a threat to South Florida.  Residents and visitors swarmed grocery stores, gas stations and department stores to stock up on essential supplies. The good news was that most South Floridians took the threat from Irma seriously.  The bad news was that grocery stores quickly ran out of food and water, while most gas stations had run out of fuel 1 to 2 days before Irma hit. Many South Floridians joined those across the state in evacuating, becoming a large part of the estimated 6+ million people who were ordered to evacuate, plus those who decided to leave town despite not being in mandatory evacuation zones. Those who left early still encountered significant traffic jams upstate. Finding gas was challenging for many. Upon driving home after the storm, people realized that many roads had either heavy traffic or flooding, which lengthened travel time.  Other South Floridians stayed for the hurricane. Some left the barrier islands to ride out the storm with relatives or friends in a non-evacuation zone. Heavy tree and fence damage was widespread. As a result, over three-quarters of electrical service customers in South Florida lost power, many for close to a week. For east coast metro areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, about 95% of the power was restored within 1 week after the hurricane.  In the western half of South Florida, including Collier, Hendry and Glades counties, over 90% of customers lost power and for periods of over a week. Heaviest damage occurred in these western areas where some structural damage was noted, along with flooding damage from storm surge and rainfall.  In Southeast Florida, structural damage was minor and mostly consisted of roof covering material and screened patios. While Irma's impacts in South Florida were significant, there is no doubt that a slightly stronger Irma and/or a slightly different path could have resulted in much more damage and loss of life and property. Hurricane Irma Infrared Satellite Loop From September 10th, 2017 Hurricane Irma Radar Image Loop from Miami WSR 88-D on September 10th, 2017 Storm Surge/Tide Collier County: the maximum surveyed inundation value was 8 feet at the Smallwood Store in Chokoloskee, with 3-5 feet across most of the island. In Everglades City, a maximum inundation of 6 feet occurred at the Everglades National Park Gulf Visitor Center, with 2-4 feet common across the town and as high as 5 feet in a few areas. Surveys conducted by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) indicated 1-2 feet of inundation as far inland as Tamiami Trail/US 41 between State Road 29 and Collier-Seminole State Park. in Goodland, about 5-6 feet of inundation was surveyed at the waterfront, with inundation of 3-4 feet across town. Marco Island had 2-4 feet of inundation, mainly on the south and east parts of the island with inland penetration of less than a half-mile. Naples had 3-4 feet of inundation at the Gulf of America and Naples Bay waterfronts and extending less than a half-mile inland. Data from a USGS rapid deployment tide gauge at the Tamiami Trail bridge over Naples Bay (image below) showed a rapid rise of 8 feet in just over 9 hours mainly on the back side of Irma during the afternoon and evening of September 10th. This rise would have likely been much greater and devastating had the center of Irma tracked just a few miles farther west. Miami-Dade County : an average of 3-5 feet of inundation occurred along the Biscayne Bay shoreline from Homestead to Downtown Miami/Brickell and extending inland 1-2 blocks, with peak surveyed inundation of slightly greater than 6 feet in isolated spots in Coconut Grove and Brickell. Inundation decreased north of Downtown Miami along the Biscayne Bay shoreline, with values generally around 2-3 feet. Along the Atlantic oceanfront, including Key Biscayne and Miami Beach, inundation was generally around 2-3 feet and confined to the immediate beachfront. Broward and Palm Beach Counties : maximum inundation of slightly greater than 3 feet along the Broward County coastline from Hallandale Beach to Fort Lauderdale, confined to the beachfront with lesser inundation affecting adjacent streets within 1-2 blocks of the beach. North of Fort Lauderdale through the Palm Beaches, inundation was generally 1-2 feet at the beachfront. Observed storm tide inundation values. Squares represent locations with measurements from tide gauges and/or NWS storm surveys Wind Irma was the first major (Category 3 or higher) hurricane to make landfall in South Florida since Wilma of 2005. The highest wind gust recorded on land in South Florida was 142 mph at a mesonet site near Naples Airport. The highest sustained wind recorded was 112 mph by a spotter on Marco Island. The map to the left is an analysis of maximum sustained winds (1-minute average) in Hurricane Irma conducted by NWS Miami.  The analysis is a best estimate based on all available data. The map on the right is from the National Hurricane Center Tropical Cyclone Report on Hurricane Irma (red- hurricane force, orange- 58-73 mph, yellow 39-57 mph). Disclaimer: some locations may have received winds slightly higher or slightly lower than shown, and does NOT include short-duration wind gusts which were at least 20-30 mph higher than the 1-minute average sustained wind speed Collier County: Sustained Category 3 winds of 111-115 mph were likely confined to a very small area of the eye that touched Marco Island and the immediate coastline of Collier County, including Goodland and Cape Romano. Sustained Category 2 winds (96-110 mph) likely extended farther inland into west-central Collier County in the eastern eye wall, including the Golden Gate Estates and Orangetree areas. All of the greater Naples area received hurricane force sustained winds, with Category 2 sustained winds likely affecting much of southern and eastern portions of Naples. Along the northern coast of Collier County to the north of Naples, sustained winds likely peaked at Category 1 strength. Farther to the northeast, Immokalee likely received Category 1 sustained winds. Peak wind gusts in Collier County reached at least Category 2 strength (95-110 mph) over most areas, with peak Category 3 and 4 gusts (111-140 mph) in the eastern eye wall. In addition, storm surveys indicated the likelihood of mini-vortices in the eastern eye wall which led to small swaths of higher winds. Glades and Hendry Counties: Sustained winds of Category 1 strength likely occurred over most of Glades and Hendry counties, with highest winds in the LaBelle and Felda areas. Wind in northeastern Glades County likely peaked at slightly below hurricane force. Peak wind gusts of Category 2 strength (95-110 mph) likely occurred in the LaBelle and Felda areas. Miami-Dade County: Most of the populated areas of Miami-Dade County experienced sustained winds of strong tropical storm force (58-73 mph). However, there were a few areas that likely experienced sustained winds of Category 1 hurricane strength.  Sustained winds may have reached hurricane force (around 75 mph) in portions of southern Key Biscayne. Although not explicitly shown on the map, it is possible that sustained winds briefly reached 75 mph within a mile of Biscayne Bay (east of Bayshore Drive and east of Old Cutler Road) from Coconut Grove to Pinecrest to Palmetto Bay.  However, more likely, sustained winds in that area peaked around 70 mph (just below hurricane force). Sustained winds likely reached the lower limits of Category 1 strength in portions of Homestead, especially southern and western portions of Homestead, including Florida City and southern portions of The Redland.  In coastal Miami-Dade County from Downtown Miami northward, including Miami Beach, North Miami Beach, Little Haiti, North Miami and Aventura, sustained winds likely peaked in the 65-70 mph range.  Sustained winds likely only reached the 55-65 mph for the western and northern parts of the metro area (west of the Palmetto expressway to Krome Avenue) including West Kendall, Doral and Miami Lakes.  Almost all of Miami-Dade County experienced peak wind gusts of Category 1 strength (80-95 mph). Broward County : One hurricane force sustained wind of 76 mph was recorded in Broward County at the Seminole Tribe Headquarters in Hollywood, so Category 1 winds are analyzed to have occurred within 1 mile of that location on our map. Elsewhere, sustained winds peaked in the 65-70 mph range in coastal and metro portions of Broward County. Sustained winds were lower in western areas such as Weston, Tamarac and Coral Springs, where the winds likely peaked in the 55-65 mph range. Gusts in most of Broward County were in the Category 1/2 range (80-100 mph). Only isolated spots had gusts over 100 mph, in the 100-110 mph range. Palm Beach County : Sustained winds peaked in the 55-65 mph range over southern coastal areas and most of central Palm Beach County. Stronger sustained winds - in the 65-70 mph range - were observed along the immediate coastline north of West Palm Beach to Jupiter. Wind gusts reached Category 1 strength (80-90 mph) county-wide. Mainland Monroe County: All of Mainland Monroe County likely received sustained winds that peaked in the Category 1 range (74-95 mph).

These areas received anywhere from 9-15 inches of rain, with estimates of up to 20 inches in the Felda area as well as the Big Cypress National Preserve. Elsewhere, rainfall totals were mainly in the 6-10 inch range. Rainfall amounts produced by Hurricane Irma in South Florida Tornadoes Five tornadoes were confirmed in South Florida in association with Irma – 1 in Miami-Dade County, 3 in Broward County and 1 in Collier County. The tornado in Collier County occurred 2 miles west of Ochopee where wooden power poles were damaged along Tamiami Trail between Ochopee and the SR-29 intersection. It was determined to be an EF-1. The tornado in Miami-Dade County occurred near Homestead Motor Speedway. In Broward County, 2 of the tornadoes were EF-1 and the other was EF-0. One of the EF-1 tornadoes occurred 4 miles west of Miramar along 172 nd avenue between Memorial Hospital and Miramar Regional Park, where sections of trees were ripped apart. The other EF-1 occurred 4 miles WNW of Miramar in the Chapel Trail Neighborhood near NW 196 th Avenue, north of Pines Blvd. There were several trees that were ripped apart in a localized area with some damage to roof tiles and screened patios. The damage pattern suggested rotation. The EF-0 tornado was a brief touchdown near Oakland Park. Damage, casualties and impacts to South Florida Deaths : Hurricane Irma was responsible for 1 direct death in South Florida. An 86 year old man in Broward County died after opening the front door of his home during the hurricane to see what was going on when a gust of wind knocked him to the floor, causing him to hit his head. There were 33 indirect deaths in South Florida which occurred before, during and after the storm, including 14 after the storm due to hyperthermia in a nursing home in Hollywood. Damage : In Collier County, at least 88 structures were destroyed and 1,500 others with major damage. Heavy tree and power pole damage occurred in areas affected by the eye wall, including Port of the Islands, Marco Island, Collier Seminole State Park, Golden Gate, Orangetree and parts of the city of Naples. In Hendry County, 42 homes were destroyed, 131 homes suffered major damage and 451 had minor damage. In Glades County, 33 structures were destroyed, 452 with major damage and 442 with minor damage. In Miami-Dade County, while there were no homes that were completely destroyed, there were 1,585 that had damage; including about 1,000 with significant damage. The majority of damage in the county was to trees and fences, with flooding damage in areas impacted by storm surge along the Biscayne Bay shoreline. Rainfall flooding lingered for at least a week after the storm in portions of Collier, Hendry and Glades counties, causing damage to homes as well as farmland. Monetary losses : Unincorporated Collier County (not including Naples, Marco Island and Everglades City) had $320 million in damage. Over 30,000 insurance claims were filed in Collier County. In Hendry County, over 2,000 insurance claims were filed. In Glades County, 669 insurance claims were filed. 50% of Miami-Dade’s agricultural crops weredamaged, resulting in damages of $245 million. 55,012 insurance claims were filed in Miami-Dade. In Broward, 38,836 insurance claims were filed. Most damage in Broward was primarily to trees and fences. In Palm Beach County, the total damage amount from Irma was reported to be $300 million.

A plus sign next to the number “[1+, 2+, etc...]” means that the information is found within the full scientific study rather than the abstract. Creatine kinase is an important enzyme needed for energy production and muscle function. Athletes have more of this enzyme in their blood, but so do obese and overweight people. High levels can tell us if there is muscle, heart, or brain damage. Keep reading to learn more about this enzyme, what it means if your levels are high or low, and how to address irregular values. What is Creatine Kinase? Creatine kinase (CK), also known as creatine phosphokinase, is an enzyme that plays a role in energy production . Higher amounts of this enzyme are found in tissues that use a lot of energy, such as the muscles (including the heart) and the brain [ 1 ]. next stay CC Settings Off Arabic Chinese English French German Hindi Portuguese Spanish Font Color white Font Opacity 100% Font Size 100% Font Family Arial Text Shadow none Background Color black Background Opacity 50% Window Color black Window Opacity 0% White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan 100% 75% 50% 25% 200% 175% 150% 125% 100% 75% 50% Arial Georgia Garamond Courier New Tahoma Times New Roman Trebuchet MS Verdana None Raised Depressed Uniform Drop Shadow White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan 100% 75% 50% 25% 0% White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan 100% 75% 50% 25% 0% Creatine kinase will leak into the blood when these tissues are damaged . That’s why blood levels of this enzyme can tell us whether there has been tissue damage, i.e. a heart attack, stroke, sports injury, or muscle disease [ 1 , 2 ]. If your creatine kinase levels are high, your doctor may order a creatine kinase isoenzyme tests to determine which type of creatine kinase enzyme is high [ 1 , 2 ]: CK-MM: muscles CK-MB: heart CK-BB: brain Normal Range There is still no universally agreed upon range for creatine kinase. Different laboratories have different normal ranges, reported in U/L (units per liter) or ukat/L (microkatals per liter). People who have greater muscle mass have higher CK levels. That is why men usually have higher CK values than women. The low normal limit for both men and women is approximately 20 – 30 U/L (0.34 – 0.51 ukat/L) . The upper normal limit for men is anywhere from 200 to 395 U/L (3.4 – 6.8 ukat/L) and for women, it’s up to 207 U/L (3.52 ukat/L) [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. CK levels are around 70% higher in healthy African Americans , compared to people of European descent! Some studies indicate that healthy black men and women can have significantly higher values than the currently recognized normal range(s) – up to 712 and 323 IU/L, respectively [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. High Creatine Kinase Levels Elevated CK points to recent tissue damage. However, it doesn’t point to a cause or the location of the damage. It is possible to be healthy and have higher CK levels. As mentioned above, people of African descent can have up to 70% higher CK levels than healthy Caucasians [ 6 , 5 , 7 ]. Your doctor will interpret this test, taking into account your medical history and other test results, and will repeat it if necessary. Furthermore, a “falsely high CK” due to exercise or other strenuous physical activity is very common . In a large community study of over 12,000 people in Norway, people who had elevated CK levels were re-tested after 3 days of rest. CK levels returned back to normal in 70% of the cases [ 8 ]. To ascertain that the rise in CK is due solely to exercise or exclude physical activity as a factor, the test should be repeated after a week of rest (i.e. 7 days without exercise). If elevated CK persists, it is more likely to be due to an underlying health issue. People who have elevated creatine kinase due to an underlying health issue may experience the following symptoms [ 9 ]: Muscle weakness Cramps Muscle pain Fatigue Inability to exercise (due to pain or weakness) Dark urine Sponsored Content 0壓力養成遊戲 By 《勝利女神：妮姬》 Causes of High Creatine Kinase Levels Causes shown below are commonly associated with elevated creatine kinase. Work with your doctor or another health care professional to get an accurate diagnosis. 1) Exercise/Training Exercise and training are the main cause of increased creatine kinase levels [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]. CK levels transiently increase to over 30 times the upper normal limit within 24 hours of strenuous physical activity and then slowly decline back to normal over the next 7 days. To what degree CK spikes depends on the type and duration of exercise [ 8 , 13 , 14 , 15 ]. Studies have shown that even stretching can increase CK [ 16 ]! Also, people who are untrained will experience greater spikes in CK levels due to greater muscle damage [ 8 ]. On the other hand, athletes have higher resting CK levels compared to non-athletes. A study of over 700 athletes suggests that normal reference ranges for athletes may be over two times higher than normal ranges: 82 – 1,083 U/L in men and 47 – 513 U/L in women [ 12 ]. Fun fact: The highest creatine kinase on record was over a million and was caused solely by a heavy workout [ 17 ] ! 2) Obesity Although higher CK levels are found in athletes, conversely, high CK levels are also found in obese and overweight people. In a study of 1,444 subjects, higher CK levels were linked with higher BMI and waist-to-hip ratio [ 18 ]. In another study of over 10,000 adults, overweight and obese men had almost 2 times greater odds of having elevated CK [ 19 ]. Similarly, in 4,500 people, CK levels were higher in people with greater body mass [ 4 ]. Scientists may have found an explanation for this. They discovered that obese and overweight people have more fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers and less slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibers. Fast-twitch muscle fibers have higher CK activity [ 4 ]. 3) Underlying Health Issues Creatine kinase will increase with muscle, heart, or brain damage – these can be caused by an underlying disease or disorder, including: Muscle injuries, physical trauma, and burns [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] Genetic muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy (i.e Duchenne muscular dystrophy) [ 25 , 26 ] Infections by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites, causing muscle wasting [ 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ] Fever, accompanied by shivering [ 31 ] Hypothermia, a dangerous drop in body temperature [ 32 ] Hormonal disorders, such as hypothyroidism , Addison’s disease, acromegaly (a disorder where the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormones), and Conn’s syndrome/hyperaldosteronism (a condition where too much aldosterone is produced in the adrenal glands) [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] Metabolic disturbances such as hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium ), or hypophosphatemia (low phosphate) [ 8 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ] Diabetes; when it causes muscle dysfunction (myopathy) [ 44 ] Some cases of autoimmune diseases when there is muscle involvement, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease [ 45 , 46 , 47 ] Heart attacks [ 1 , 48 , 49 ] Head/brain injury [ 50 , 51 , 52 ] Seizures [ 53 , 54 ] Some cancers [ 55 , 56 ] 4) Medical Interventions Interventions that damage tissues, such as injections into the muscles or any type of surgery, will increase CK levels [ 8 , 57 , 58 ]. 5) Drugs and Toxins Cocaine increases CK levels [ 59 , 60 , 61 ]. Some pharmaceutical drugs also have the potential to increase CK: Statins, the cholesterol -lowering drugs. In fact, muscle symptoms are the most frequent side effect of statin therapy [ 62 , 63 , 64 ] Fibrates, another group of drugs that decrease cholesterol [ 8 , 65 ] Beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers used to decrease blood pressure [ 66 , 8 , 67 ] Glucocorticoids used to decrease inflammation [ 68 ] Antipsychotics [ 69 ] Antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and antimalarials [ 70 , 71 , 72 , 8 , 73 ] Isotretinoin, an acne medication [ 74 ] Colchicine, used to prevent gout [ 75 ] Chemotherapy drugs [ 76 ] Finally, toxins like snake venom or carbon monoxide can increase CK levels [ 77 , 78 ]. Health Effects of High Creatine Kinase Level 1) May Be Linked to Lower Inflammation A study with over 12,000 people found that higher CK was linked to lower hs-CRP , which is a measure of chronic inflammation [ 79 ]. The same association was found in another study of 454 overweight and obese people [ 80 ]. 2) May Prevent Blood Clotting High plasma CK, even in the normal range, may decrease the ability of our blood to clot properly. This is especially the case after exercise when CK levels spike [ 81 ]. Decreasing Creatine Kinase Elevated creatine kinase can be a sign of serious tissue damage or an underlying disease or disorder. The most important thing is to work with your doctor to find out what’s causing your elevated creatine kinase and to treat any underlying condition! Refrain from strenuous exercise before testing. It causes muscle damage and increases CK levels [ 10 , 11 , 12 ]. Discuss the lifestyle changes listed below with your doctor. None of these strategies should ever be done in place of what your doctor recommends or prescribes! 1) Improve Muscle Recovery If your CK gets high because your muscles get damaged after exercise, there are some steps you can take to improve muscle recovery. Studies suggest that after strenuous exercise, an increase in creatine kinase (muscle damage) can be attenuated by consuming enough carbs, protein, and antioxidants [ 82 ]. A small study with 14 men showed that sports massage 2 hours after exercise decrease CK levels [ 83 ]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that light therapy (low-level laser therapy and/or light-emitting diode therapy) had beneficial effects on decreasing CK levels after exercise [ 84 ]. 2) Lose Weight If Overweight Lose some weight if you are overweight. People with higher BMI and weight have increased creatine kinase levels [ 4 , 18 ]. Low Creatine Kinase Levels Causes of Low Creatine Kinase Levels 1) Low Muscle Mass The most common cause of low creatine kinase levels is muscle wasting (muscle atrophy) due to physical inactivity, illnesses, or old age [ 85 ]. 2) Inflammation in Autoimmune Disease Creatine kinase levels can be significantly reduced in autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis [ 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ]. The more inflammation there is, the lower creatine kinase levels can get. 3) Pregnancy Total creatine kinase levels are reduced in the second trimester of pregnancy. However, they increase in late pregnancy [ 90 ]. Health Effects of Low Creatine Kinase Levels 1) Are Linked to Fainting Studies suggest that the more creatine kinase a person has within the normal range, the better their heart and muscles can function. In a study of 442 people, people with low creatine kinase levels were 73% more likely to faint [ 91 ]. 2) Increase Risk of Death Because creatine kinase is a measure of muscle mass, it is not surprising that a link was found between low creatine kinase levels and higher mortality. Critically ill people who are weaker (with less muscle mass) have a higher risk of dying [ 92 ]. In two studies with over 1.8k patients each, critically ill and chronic kidney disease patients with low creatine kinase levels had higher mortality rates [ 93 , 94 ]. Increasing Creatine Kinase The most important thing is to work with your doctor to find out what’s causing your low creatine kinase and to treat any underlying condition! Discuss the lifestyle changes listed below with your doctor. None of these strategies should ever be done in place of what your doctor recommends or prescribes! 1) Exercise Exercise and physical activity, in general, build muscle and thereby increase creatine kinase levels. Most athletes have high CK levels [ 11 , 85 ]. 2) Protein-Sufficient Diet and Muscle-Building Supplements Make sure your diet has enough protein to sustain your health and your level of physical activity. A study suggests that creatine supplementation may help build muscle and increase creatine kinase activity in athletes [ 95 ]. Remember, always speak to your doctor before taking any supplements, because they may interfere with your health condition or your treatment/medications! Contents What is Creatine Kinase?

Translucent Egg Purpose To demonstrate how to create a translucent (naked) egg by causing a chemical reaction to break-down its calcium and erode it’s shell. Additional information The incredible edible egg! After this experiment you may want to think twice before actually eating it. By the time you're done you'll have a translucent egg where you can actually see the egg yolk sloshing around as you shake it. We'll do this by causing a chemical reaction to break down the calcium of the egg shell, eroding it down to the egg membrane. Calcium is the chemical element with the atomic number 20 and the CA symbol. It’s the 5th most abundant element by mass in the earths crust. Sponsored Links Required materials One or more eggs (raw, not hard-boiled) Large glass jar or tall drinking glass White vinegar Pen or pencil Journal (to record your results) Estimated Experiment Time About 5 minutes to set-up, another 72 hours for results. Step-By-Step Procedure 1. Place your raw egg in your jar or drinking glass. 2. Pour vinegar into the jar or glass until the egg is completely submerged in the vinegar. 3. Place the jar or glass in a location where it will remain for 24 hours undisturbed. 4. After 24 hours, observe the egg. What do you see? Note the results in your journal (you should see tiny bubbles starting to form on the egg shell). 5. Drain the old vinegar from the glass into a sink. You want to be very careful not to drop your egg! It's recommended you use a strainer to keep your egg from falling down the drain. Once drained, fill the jar or glass with fresh vinegar so that the egg is once again completely submerged. 6. Once again place the jar or glass in a safe place where the egg can remain undisturbed for an additional 48 hours (2 days this time). 7. After another 48 hours has passed, observe the egg and write down noticeable changes in your journal. 8. Very carefully pour the old vinegar from the jar or glass and into a sink. 9. Carefully remove the egg and rinse it under low-running cold water. What do you see? The egg shell should be completely dissolved, creating a translucent egg! All that remains is the egg membrane. Note the results in your journal. Note DO NOT EAT THIS EGG! Never eat raw eggs as they can result in serious illness. Observation What do you think would happen if you let the egg soak in the vinegar for longer? How about if you left it in there for 1 week? How about a month? Give it a try and see for yourself! You can also try other liquids to see how the egg reacts to being submerged in them. Result The egg shell is made from calcium carbonate. When the egg is subjected to prolonged exposure of the vinegar (an acetic acid), the vinegar reacts with the calcium carbonate of the shell by breaking it into calcium and carbon dioxide gas, eroding the shell.

    "html": "Math Tutor Explains: What is 16/20 as a percent? | Thinkster Math Math Tutor Explains: What is 16/20 as a percent? A fraction represents a part of a whole, and another common way to express this is as a percentage. In this guide, a math tutor will walk you through the step-by-step process of converting 16/20 into a percentage. Math Tutor's Solution: 16/20 as a percent is 80% Methods Method 1 from a Tutor– Converting 16/20 Into a Percentage: First, a math tutor will go over what a fraction represents. The number above the line is called the numerator, while the number below the line is called the denominator. The fraction shows how many portions of the number there are, in relation to how many would make up the whole. For instance, in the fraction 16/20, we could say that the value is 16 portions, out of a possible 20 portions to make up the whole. For percentages, the difference is that we want to know how many portions there are if there are 100 portions possible. “Percent” means “per hundred”. For example, if we look at the percentage 25%, that means we have 25 portions of the possible 100 portions. Re-writing this in fraction form, we see 25/100. The first step in converting a fraction to a percentage is to adjust the fraction so that the denominator is 100. To do this, you first divide 100 by the denominator: 100 20 = 5 \\frac{100}{20} = 5 20 100 ​ = 5 We can then adjust the whole fraction using this number, like so: 16 ∗ 5 20 ∗ 5 = 80 100 \\frac{16*5}{20*5} = \\frac{80}{100} 20 ∗ 5 16 ∗ 5 ​ = 100 80 ​ Reading this as a fraction, we can say that we have 80 portions of a possible 100 portions. Re-writing this as a percentage, we can see that 16/20 as a percentage is 80% x Please enable JavaScript Video Player is loading.

We can do this by simply dividing the numerator by the denominator: 16 20 = 0.8 \\frac{16}{20} = 0.8 20 16 ​ = 0.8 Once we have the answer, we can multiply the new decimal by 100 to get the percentage: 0.8 × 100 = 80 As you can see, we get the same answer as the first method and find that 16/20 as a percentage is 80%.

A fraction represents a part of a whole, and another common way to express this is as a percentage. In this guide, a math tutor will walk you through the step-by-step process of converting 16/20 into a percentage. Math Tutor's Solution: 16/20 as a percent is 80% Methods Method 1 from a Tutor– Converting 16/20 Into a Percentage: First, a math tutor will go over what a fraction represents. The number above the line is called the numerator, while the number below the line is called the denominator. The fraction shows how many portions of the number there are, in relation to how many would make up the whole. For instance, in the fraction 16/20, we could say that the value is 16 portions, out of a possible 20 portions to make up the whole. For percentages, the difference is that we want to know how many portions there are if there are 100 portions possible. “Percent” means “per hundred”. For example, if we look at the percentage 25%, that means we have 25 portions of the possible 100 portions. Re-writing this in fraction form, we see 25/100. The first step in converting a fraction to a percentage is to adjust the fraction so that the denominator is 100. To do this, you first divide 100 by the denominator: 100 20 = 5 \\frac{100}{20} = 5 20 100 ​ = 5 We can then adjust the whole fraction using this number, like so: 16 ∗ 5 20 ∗ 5 = 80 100 \\frac{16*5}{20*5} = \\frac{80}{100} 20 ∗ 5 16 ∗ 5 ​ = 100 80 ​ Reading this as a fraction, we can say that we have 80 portions of a possible 100 portions. Re-writing this as a percentage, we can see that 16/20 as a percentage is 80% x Please enable JavaScript Video Player is loading.

We can do this by simply dividing the numerator by the denominator: 16 20 = 0.8 \\frac{16}{20} = 0.8 20 16 ​ = 0.8 Once we have the answer, we can multiply the new decimal by 100 to get the percentage: 0.8 × 100 = 80 As you can see, we get the same answer as the first method and find that 16/20 as a percentage is 80%.

At all of my interviews I have concluded by thanking the interviewer for their time etc., but never sent a thank you email. To me, it seems redundant, pushy, and smarmy. Or is this common practice? What would you think if you were hiring? (In general, not necessarily looking for advice w.r.t. a particular industry) Physics news on Phys.org Theoretical model provides fresh route to more efficient cooling using light and heat From landslides to pharmaceuticals: High-precision model simulates complex granular and fluid interactions Scientists observe collective behavior of femtoscopic droplets at CERN Apr 9, 2021 #2 hutchphd Science Advisor Homework Helper 6,875 5,947 I think it depends upon the interview, but a short thank you could hardly be considered ill-mannered. If it really is perfunctory be sure to title it as a \"short thank you\" to aid the person in question when looking at his inbox. If you had good chemistry recapitulate something amusing about the interview that you appreciated. Or even some small additional tidbit you feel useful. Almost everyone likes recognition, and a sincere and well-crafted note fills the bill. There is an art to \"business friendships\" as with any other kind (and sometimes they can morph). I am fundamentally a shy person and understand your aversion, but I believe you are incorrect about this. Apr 9, 2021 #3 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 It depends on how you write the note. It gives you brownie points and reminds the interviewer that you were astute enough to get his email and proactive enough to write a thank you. You could also include a few questions you had about the position and perhaps point out something you forgot to mention. There are examples online of how to write a thank you letter that may guide you to write a nice one. This is where young people fall down on. They send the same resume to every company. They don't go the extra distance to hunt down a job via networking through their friends or through technical circles. They dutifully send stuff into the HR dumpster where resumes are scanned and stored for future reference if ever. They don't look for ways to get directly to the hiring manager. Your fundamental shyness means you won't get the salary you deserve because you'll likely not counteroffer for fear of losing the opportunity even though you know the first offer from a company is conservative and any promises they make to the contrary will likely not be honored in the future. Sometimes though for your first job this is okay because then you'll feel more comfortable when pursuing your next job. Apr 9, 2021 #4 Choppy Science Advisor Education Advisor Insights Author 4,985 2,485 In all the hiring committees I've been on, I have never seen a candidate disqualified for sending a polite thank-you email. I have seen committee members impressed when candidates take the time to do so. Apr 9, 2021 #5 Locrian 1,881 256 I've never done it yet and don't plan to start. But it's easy and might help, so maybe you should? Apr 9, 2021 #6 Dale Mentor Insights Author 36,186 14,734 mathmollusk said: Is it really common practice to send a thank you email after a job interview? It is not common practice, that is exactly why you should do it. If I have two equally qualified candidates and one sends a thank you note and the other doesn’t then the one with the thank you note has just demonstrated friendliness and conscientiousness. I immediately believe they would be more enjoyable to work with and that they would be more likely to treat customers well. I have often had equally qualified applicants. Apr 9, 2021 #7 gleem Science Advisor Education Advisor 2,660 2,116 It has become commonplace to send a thank you note after an interview. A thank you note shows interest in the company and you can never show too much interest. Apr 9, 2021 #8 symbolipoint Homework Helper Education Advisor Gold Member 7,442 1,924 mathmollusk said: Is it really common practice to send ,... To me, it seems redundant, pushy, and smarmy. ... I generally feel the way you do. Sending \"ThankYou\" letter probably not a bad idea but also probably meaningless. Either you are qualified for the job or you're not; either the interviewers like you or they do not. A possible strategy - do you have something you wish to emphasize which can be combined with a written expression of gratitude? But if you make a written claim or statement you wish to emphasize, you must do so honestly. (Like you might say basically, ' I would suit this part of the work well because I have done such or other experience and / done some task of the same kind for Q number of months',... whatever. I surely was hired for a few jobs in which I did send a letter of gratitude, but like I say, doing so was almost certainly not what helped me achieve hire. Apr 10, 2021 #9 Choppy Science Advisor Education Advisor Insights Author 4,985 2,485 There's a principle in the marketing world referred to as the \"seven touches\" of advertising. The idea is that it takes about seven interactions with a potential customer before they will purchase your product. A \"touch\" refers to things like: seeing your ad, a phone call, a direct meeting, a word-of-mouth contact from a friend, etc. So in terms of something like a job hunt, and a thank-you email, you might think of this as one of those seven touches. Here are a few contexts in which it could help... If you've ever been on a hiring committee, after seriously reviewing about five to seven candidates, they start to blend together. It becomes difficult to remember which attributes or qualities go with which candidate and often committee members have to rely on notes they've taken. A thank-you email helps to solidify you in the working memory of those on the hiring committee. It's an opportunity to provide follow up information. If during an interview you forgot to mention some relevant experience, or if there's something about yourself you felt wasn't emphasized enough, the follow-up email is a means of presenting that in a way where you have the opportunity to reflect on it and word it precisely. You can use it to invite feedback. If there's a reason why you are no longer in the running, a direct email gives potential employers an immediate means of explaining it, and that can give you actionable feedback to improve your candidacy for the next opportunity. It's an opportunity to invite consideration for other positions. If you're not successful, you can tell them you're really impressed with their company, that kind of position, etc. and that you're interested if something similar comes up. Remember, an unsuccessful interview for a previous position can be a \"touch point\" for if you're interested in another position later on. It also gives you the opportunity to give the potential employer feedback. Remember the interview is a two-way street. If they are not offering a competitive benefits package, it's possible they're not aware of that--particularly with smaller employers. Giving them that feedback invites an opportunity for further negotiation. Apr 10, 2021 #10 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 One other potent feature of a thank you is to bring up some common interest that may have been disclosed like music, opera, Sci fi books, games or shows. My boss reached out and got a hot candidate by appealing to their interest in Sci fi by sending a note to them with a short story he had written. Another boss I had, remarked one time that the new candidate was really into classical music and that impressed her because her own son was a professional opera singer. These connections may come up in an interview and while you won’t dwell on it during the interview it’s ideal for follow up notes and can improve your chances to make a good impression. Another is a college connection where you and the interviewer or someone you met from his/her team went to the same school with the same or similar major. Common profs, common courses, common college events, common college hangouts... Apr 10, 2021 #11 gmax137 Science Advisor Education Advisor 3,088 3,489 I don't know, I think many of the responses here approach redundant, pushy, and smarmy territory. Are we talking about a thank you note? Then, if you truly feel grateful for the interview opportunity, just say so: \"Thank you very much, I enjoyed our talk.\" Don't make this a second interview (you had your chance already); don't require any action on the part of the interviewer. A genuine thank-you is its own reward. Apr 10, 2021 #12 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 The response can be more than a simple thank you. As @gmax137 said you can lead with I enjoyed our talk and then mention whatever topic and go from there. It could be the interviewer mentioned some problem they are struggling with and you took it to heart and looked into it after your interview (yes that's something you should consider doing) and let them know that perhaps you've discovered an approach could work. Bosses love people who take the initiative unasked and go with it and solve a longstanding problem. It's really up to you as to what is important whether you send one or not will something you decide. We can't read the vibes you got from your interview and so there's no way in knowing exactly what you should do. The key point is to drop your preconceptions, or your view of smarmyness. You shouldn't be thinking of your own personal image, you're trying to get a job whatever works works. Don't let your preconceptions limit your actions, so many people do that already. Be different, be original, be yourself. Apr 10, 2021 #13 hutchphd Science Advisor Homework Helper 6,875 5,947 Unless you are just scrambling for any job that is offered, there is a silver (non smarmy) lining to this. Very often for a job I really want the interview will have been a useful and interesting exchange of ideas. Writing a thank you note then becomes a sincere human interaction with people you wish to see again. If in fact you hated the interview, then probably the note itself is irrelevant. If it seems smarmy to you, you should ask yourself: why? Apr 10, 2021 #14 Dale Mentor Insights Author 36,186 14,734 Personally, if you think a thank you note is smarmy then I would probably rather have someone else fill that role in my organization anyway. Apr 10, 2021 #15 symbolipoint Homework Helper Education Advisor Gold Member 7,442 1,924 Choppy's #4: It's an opportunity to invite consideration for other positions.

Remember, an unsuccessful interview for a previous position can be a \"touch point\" for if you're interested in another position later on. That can be great, but just be HONEST. Do not try to trick for confidence. Apr 10, 2021 #16 Zap 406 120 I always send a thank you letter, if I actually interviewed with someone at the company. That's definitely common practice, and something you should do. I even have a signature containing my photo and links to my resume, outlook, LinkedIn and GitHub right under the emails, for extra brownie points. Apr 10, 2021 #17 MidgetDwarf 1,559 688 Personally. Writing a thank you note is equivalent to brown nosing (IMO). Now, if you felt that the interview was insightful and the interviewer was warm, but you were passed over for another. Then a thank-you letter requesting possible feedback on self-improvement for future interviews, not necessarily at the same company, is not brown nosing... I personally would never work for an employer who values brown nosing in the guise of thank-you letters. (you know the old saying... Being respectful, humble, and hardworking are the only way to receive recognition and respect in the work force...) Apr 11, 2021 #18 Zap 406 120 I think most people will receive a thank you letter for what it is, and a very few may be agitated by it, for whatever reason. So, I tend to do it, mostly to fulfill the formality. Apr 11, 2021 #19 Dale Mentor Insights Author 36,186 14,734 To people who think that a sincere thank you note is either “smarmy” or “brown nosing” or otherwise negative: what is wrong with you? Are you incapable of honestly feeling and expressing gratitude? Do you therefore erroneously assume that all such expressions must be insincere? Do you think that you are too superior be bothered with simple decency and thoughtfulness? Are you so prideful that simply feeling gratitude and saying “thank you” is an affront to your ego? If you don’t have it in you to feel gratitude and sincerely say “thank you” for an interview then don’t be terribly surprised if you occasionally get passed up for someone who did. If you didn’t feel it for that specific interview then it probably was not a good fit anyway, but if you never feel it for any interview then that is a deficiency in you, not in those that did.

Apr 11, 2021 #22 Zap 406 120 Some people will get triggered by you addressing them as \"Dear\" in an email. However, I don't believe these people are of the majority. Dear is a formality. Apr 11, 2021 #23 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 Rather than continue this thread discussion to the point of a thank you note, I will close it now. We have covered the many facets and interpretations of the thank you note. Personally I would send one but that’s just me. I’m a sincere person and am not at all offended if someone thinks my note is smarmy. If they did then I wouldn’t want to work for that person anyways. Suspicious bosses tend to micromanage everything and not give their employees a chance to grow. I’ve had both and know the feeling. In any event, thank you all for contributing here. Let your spider sense decide whether to send a thank you. There are many resources online for how best to write one you choose to do so. Just don’t let procrastination be your reason for not doing it.

They dutifully send stuff into the HR dumpster where resumes are scanned and stored for future reference if ever. They don't look for ways to get directly to the hiring manager. Your fundamental shyness means you won't get the salary you deserve because you'll likely not counteroffer for fear of losing the opportunity even though you know the first offer from a company is conservative and any promises they make to the contrary will likely not be honored in the future. Sometimes though for your first job this is okay because then you'll feel more comfortable when pursuing your next job. Apr 9, 2021 #4 Choppy Science Advisor Education Advisor Insights Author 4,985 2,485 In all the hiring committees I've been on, I have never seen a candidate disqualified for sending a polite thank-you email. I have seen committee members impressed when candidates take the time to do so. Apr 9, 2021 #5 Locrian 1,881 256 I've never done it yet and don't plan to start. But it's easy and might help, so maybe you should?

It is not common practice, that is exactly why you should do it. If I have two equally qualified candidates and one sends a thank you note and the other doesn’t then the one with the thank you note has just demonstrated friendliness and conscientiousness. I immediately believe they would be more enjoyable to work with and that they would be more likely to treat customers well. I have often had equally qualified applicants. Apr 9, 2021 #7 gleem Science Advisor Education Advisor 2,660 2,116 It has become commonplace to send a thank you note after an interview. A thank you note shows interest in the company and you can never show too much interest.

I generally feel the way you do. Sending \"ThankYou\" letter probably not a bad idea but also probably meaningless. Either you are qualified for the job or you're not; either the interviewers like you or they do not. A possible strategy - do you have something you wish to emphasize which can be combined with a written expression of gratitude? But if you make a written claim or statement you wish to emphasize, you must do so honestly. (Like you might say basically, ' I would suit this part of the work well because I have done such or other experience and / done some task of the same kind for Q number of months',... whatever. I surely was hired for a few jobs in which I did send a letter of gratitude, but like I say, doing so was almost certainly not what helped me achieve hire. Apr 10, 2021 #9 Choppy Science Advisor Education Advisor Insights Author 4,985 2,485 There's a principle in the marketing world referred to as the \"seven touches\" of advertising. The idea is that it takes about seven interactions with a potential customer before they will purchase your product. A \"touch\" refers to things like: seeing your ad, a phone call, a direct meeting, a word-of-mouth contact from a friend, etc. So in terms of something like a job hunt, and a thank-you email, you might think of this as one of those seven touches. Here are a few contexts in which it could help... If you've ever been on a hiring committee, after seriously reviewing about five to seven candidates, they start to blend together. It becomes difficult to remember which attributes or qualities go with which candidate and often committee members have to rely on notes they've taken. A thank-you email helps to solidify you in the working memory of those on the hiring committee. It's an opportunity to provide follow up information. If during an interview you forgot to mention some relevant experience, or if there's something about yourself you felt wasn't emphasized enough, the follow-up email is a means of presenting that in a way where you have the opportunity to reflect on it and word it precisely. You can use it to invite feedback. If there's a reason why you are no longer in the running, a direct email gives potential employers an immediate means of explaining it, and that can give you actionable feedback to improve your candidacy for the next opportunity. It's an opportunity to invite consideration for other positions. If you're not successful, you can tell them you're really impressed with their company, that kind of position, etc. and that you're interested if something similar comes up. Remember, an unsuccessful interview for a previous position can be a \"touch point\" for if you're interested in another position later on. It also gives you the opportunity to give the potential employer feedback. Remember the interview is a two-way street. If they are not offering a competitive benefits package, it's possible they're not aware of that--particularly with smaller employers. Giving them that feedback invites an opportunity for further negotiation. Apr 10, 2021 #10 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 One other potent feature of a thank you is to bring up some common interest that may have been disclosed like music, opera, Sci fi books, games or shows. My boss reached out and got a hot candidate by appealing to their interest in Sci fi by sending a note to them with a short story he had written. Another boss I had, remarked one time that the new candidate was really into classical music and that impressed her because her own son was a professional opera singer. These connections may come up in an interview and while you won’t dwell on it during the interview it’s ideal for follow up notes and can improve your chances to make a good impression. Another is a college connection where you and the interviewer or someone you met from his/her team went to the same school with the same or similar major. Common profs, common courses, common college events, common college hangouts... Apr 10, 2021 #11 gmax137 Science Advisor Education Advisor 3,088 3,489 I don't know, I think many of the responses here approach redundant, pushy, and smarmy territory. Are we talking about a thank you note? Then, if you truly feel grateful for the interview opportunity, just say so: \"Thank you very much, I enjoyed our talk.\" Don't make this a second interview (you had your chance already); don't require any action on the part of the interviewer. A genuine thank-you is its own reward. Apr 10, 2021 #12 jedishrfu Mentor Insights Author 15,300 9,918 The response can be more than a simple thank you. As @gmax137 said you can lead with I enjoyed our talk and then mention whatever topic and go from there. It could be the interviewer mentioned some problem they are struggling with and you took it to heart and looked into it after your interview (yes that's something you should consider doing) and let them know that perhaps you've discovered an approach could work. Bosses love people who take the initiative unasked and go with it and solve a longstanding problem. It's really up to you as to what is important whether you send one or not will something you decide. We can't read the vibes you got from your interview and so there's no way in knowing exactly what you should do. The key point is to drop your preconceptions, or your view of smarmyness. You shouldn't be thinking of your own personal image, you're trying to get a job whatever works works. Don't let your preconceptions limit your actions, so many people do that already. Be different, be original, be yourself. Apr 10, 2021 #13 hutchphd Science Advisor Homework Helper 6,875 5,947 Unless you are just scrambling for any job that is offered, there is a silver (non smarmy) lining to this. Very often for a job I really want the interview will have been a useful and interesting exchange of ideas. Writing a thank you note then becomes a sincere human interaction with people you wish to see again. If in fact you hated the interview, then probably the note itself is irrelevant. If it seems smarmy to you, you should ask yourself: why? Apr 10, 2021 #14 Dale Mentor Insights Author 36,186 14,734 Personally, if you think a thank you note is smarmy then I would probably rather have someone else fill that role in my organization anyway.

That's definitely common practice, and something you should do. I even have a signature containing my photo and links to my resume, outlook, LinkedIn and GitHub right under the emails, for extra brownie points. Apr 10, 2021 #17 MidgetDwarf 1,559 688 Personally. Writing a thank you note is equivalent to brown nosing (IMO). Now, if you felt that the interview was insightful and the interviewer was warm, but you were passed over for another. Then a thank-you letter requesting possible feedback on self-improvement for future interviews, not necessarily at the same company, is not brown nosing... I personally would never work for an employer who values brown nosing in the guise of thank-you letters. (you know the old saying... Being respectful, humble, and hardworking are the only way to receive recognition and respect in the work force...) Apr 11, 2021 #18 Zap 406 120 I think most people will receive a thank you letter for what it is, and a very few may be agitated by it, for whatever reason. So, I tend to do it, mostly to fulfill the formality.

Are you incapable of honestly feeling and expressing gratitude? Do you therefore erroneously assume that all such expressions must be insincere? Do you think that you are too superior be bothered with simple decency and thoughtfulness? Are you so prideful that simply feeling gratitude and saying “thank you” is an affront to your ego? If you don’t have it in you to feel gratitude and sincerely say “thank you” for an interview then don’t be terribly surprised if you occasionally get passed up for someone who did. If you didn’t feel it for that specific interview then it probably was not a good fit anyway, but if you never feel it for any interview then that is a deficiency in you, not in those that did.

We have covered the many facets and interpretations of the thank you note. Personally I would send one but that’s just me. I’m a sincere person and am not at all offended if someone thinks my note is smarmy. If they did then I wouldn’t want to work for that person anyways. Suspicious bosses tend to micromanage everything and not give their employees a chance to grow. I’ve had both and know the feeling. In any event, thank you all for contributing here. Let your spider sense decide whether to send a thank you. There are many resources online for how best to write one you choose to do so. Just don’t let procrastination be your reason for not doing it.

But what happens if the degree is greater in the numerator than in the denominator? Content Continues Below MathHelp.com Recall that, when the degree of the denominator was bigger than that of the numerator, we saw that the value in the denominator got so much bigger, so quickly, that it was so much stronger that it pulled the functional value to zero, giving us a horizontal asymptote of the x -axis. Reasonably, then, if the numerator has a power that is larger than that of the denominator, then the value of the numerator ought to be stronger, and ought to pull the graph away from the x -axis; that is, it ought to pull the graph away from the line y = 0 and away from any other fixed y -value. To investigate this , let's look at the following function: y = − 3 x 2 + 2 x − 1 y = \\dfrac{-3x^2 + 2}{x - 1} y = x − 1 − 3 x 2 + 2 ​ For reasons that will shortly become clear, I'm going to apply long polynomial division to this rational expression. My work looks like this: − 3 x − 3 + 2 x − 1 ) − 3 x 2 + 0 x 0 0 0 + 2 ‾ − 3 x 2 + 3 x + 2 ‾ − 3 x + 2 − 3 x + 3 ‾ − 1 \\small{ \\begin{array}{r} -3x\\enspace -3\\, \\phantom{+2} \\\\ x-1 \\overline{\\smash{\\big)} \\, -3x^2 + 0x\\vphantom{0^{0^0}} + 2} \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{-3x^2 + 3x \\phantom{+2}} \\\\[0.5em] -3x+2 \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{-3x+3} \\\\[0.5em] -1 \\end{array} } − 3 x − 3 + 2 x − 1 ) − 3 x 2 + 0 x 0 0 0 + 2 ​ − 3 x 2 + 3 x + 2 ​ − 3 x + 2 − 3 x + 3 ​ − 1 ​ Across the top is the quotient, being the linear polynomial expression −3 x − 3 . At the bottom is the remainder. This means that, via long division, I can convert the original rational function they gave me into something akin to what would be mixed-number format in numerical values: y = − 3 x − 3 + − 1 x − 1 y = -3x - 3 + \\dfrac{-1}{x - 1} y = − 3 x − 3 + x − 1 − 1 ​ This is the exact same function. All I've done is rearrange it a bit. Why? You're about to see. First, take a look at the graph of the rational function they gave us: The parts in the middle, where the line goes pretty much straight up though the top and then comes pretty much straight up from the bottom, indicate where there's a vertical asymptote (at x = 1 ). But what about the slanty parts, that seem to kind of line up with each other? Thinking back to the results of my long division, we know what the graph of y = −3 x − 3 looks like; it's a decreasing straight line that crosses the y -axis at −3 , having a slope of m = −3 . Now take a look at this second graph of the same rational function, but with the line y = −3 x − 3 superimposed on it: As you can see, apart from the middle of the plot near the origin (that is, apart from when the graph is close to the vertical asymptote), the graph hugs the line y = −3 x − 3 . Because of this \"skinnying along the line\" behavior of the graph, the line y = −3 x − 3 is an asymptote. Clearly, though, it's not a horizontal asymptote. Instead, because this asymptote is slanted or, in fancy terminology, \"oblique\", this is called a slant (or oblique) asymptote. Affiliate Affordable tutors for hire Find tutors The graph above illustrates the fact that, if the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator (so that the polynomial fraction is an \"improper\" fraction), then the graph of the rational function will be, roughly, a slanty straight line with some fiddly bits in the middle. Why does it work like this? Because of the how the long division works out. The degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, so the long division will give you a degree- 1 (that is, a linear) polynomial part (in other words, something of the form m x + b ) and a \"proper\" fractional part. We already know that, off to the sides, the fractional part will quickly go to the x -axis; that is, its value will quickly get, and stay, close to zero. So, off to the sides, the graph will pretty much boil down to (the linear polynomial part) plus (zero). In other words, most of the graph will be approximately equal to the linear polynomial part. Because the graph will be nearly equal to this slanted straight-line equivalent, the asymptote for this sort of rational function is called a slant (or \"oblique\") asymptote. The equation for the slant asymptote is the polynomial part of the rational that you get after doing the long division. (By the way, this relationship — between an improper rational function, its associated polynomial, and its graph — holds true regardless of the difference in the degrees of the numerator and denominator. However, in most textbooks, they only have you work with a degree-difference of one.) Content Continues Below To summarize: What is a slant (or oblique) asymptote? Suppose a rational function has a numerator whose degree is exactly 1 greater than the denominator's degree. The slant (or oblique) asymptote for that rational function is a straight (but not horizontal or vertical) line that shows where the graph goes, off to the sides. How do you find the slant (or oblique) asymptote? To find the slant asymptote, do the long division of the numerator by the denominator. The result will be a degree- 2 polynomial part (across the top of the long division) and a proper fractional part (formed by dividing the remainder by the denominattor). The linear polynomial, when set equal to y , is the slant asymptote. What is the difference between slant, horizontal, and vertical asymptotes? Vertical asymptotes are caused by zeroes of the denominator; they indicate where the graph must *never* go, as this would cause division by zero. As a result, they can *never* be touched or crossed. Horizontal asymptotes are caused by the numerator having a degree that is smaller than, or equal to, the degree of the denominator; they indicate where the graph will be when it's off to the sides (away from vertical asymptotes, etc). Horizontal asymptotes can be touched and/or crossed. Slant asymptotes are caused by the numerator having a degree that is 1 greater than that of the denominator; they indicate where the graph will be when it's off to the sides. Slant asymptotes can be touched and/or crossed.

My work looks like this: − 3 x − 3 + 2 x − 1 ) − 3 x 2 + 0 x 0 0 0 + 2 ‾ − 3 x 2 + 3 x + 2 ‾ − 3 x + 2 − 3 x + 3 ‾ − 1 \\small{ \\begin{array}{r} -3x\\enspace -3\\, \\phantom{+2} \\\\ x-1 \\overline{\\smash{\\big)} \\, -3x^2 + 0x\\vphantom{0^{0^0}} + 2} \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{-3x^2 + 3x \\phantom{+2}} \\\\[0.5em] -3x+2 \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{-3x+3} \\\\[0.5em] -1 \\end{array} } − 3 x − 3 + 2 x − 1 ) − 3 x 2 + 0 x 0 0 0 + 2 ​ − 3 x 2 + 3 x + 2 ​ − 3 x + 2 − 3 x + 3 ​ − 1 ​ Across the top is the quotient, being the linear polynomial expression −3 x − 3 . At the bottom is the remainder. This means that, via long division, I can convert the original rational function they gave me into something akin to what would be mixed-number format in numerical values: y = − 3 x − 3 + − 1 x − 1 y = -3x - 3 + \\dfrac{-1}{x - 1} y = − 3 x − 3 + x − 1 − 1 ​ This is the exact same function. All I've done is rearrange it a bit. Why? You're about to see. First, take a look at the graph of the rational function they gave us: The parts in the middle, where the line goes pretty much straight up though the top and then comes pretty much straight up from the bottom, indicate where there's a vertical asymptote (at x = 1 ). But what about the slanty parts, that seem to kind of line up with each other? Thinking back to the results of my long division, we know what the graph of y = −3 x − 3 looks like; it's a decreasing straight line that crosses the y -axis at −3 , having a slope of m = −3 . Now take a look at this second graph of the same rational function, but with the line y = −3 x − 3 superimposed on it: As you can see, apart from the middle of the plot near the origin (that is, apart from when the graph is close to the vertical asymptote), the graph hugs the line y = −3 x − 3 . Because of this \"skinnying along the line\" behavior of the graph, the line y = −3 x − 3 is an asymptote. Clearly, though, it's not a horizontal asymptote. Instead, because this asymptote is slanted or, in fancy terminology, \"oblique\", this is called a slant (or oblique) asymptote. Affiliate Affordable tutors for hire Find tutors The graph above illustrates the fact that, if the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator (so that the polynomial fraction is an \"improper\" fraction), then the graph of the rational function will be, roughly, a slanty straight line with some fiddly bits in the middle. Why does it work like this? Because of the how the long division works out. The degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, so the long division will give you a degree- 1 (that is, a linear) polynomial part (in other words, something of the form m x + b ) and a \"proper\" fractional part. We already know that, off to the sides, the fractional part will quickly go to the x -axis; that is, its value will quickly get, and stay, close to zero. So, off to the sides, the graph will pretty much boil down to (the linear polynomial part) plus (zero). In other words, most of the graph will be approximately equal to the linear polynomial part. Because the graph will be nearly equal to this slanted straight-line equivalent, the asymptote for this sort of rational function is called a slant (or \"oblique\") asymptote. The equation for the slant asymptote is the polynomial part of the rational that you get after doing the long division. (By the way, this relationship — between an improper rational function, its associated polynomial, and its graph — holds true regardless of the difference in the degrees of the numerator and denominator. However, in most textbooks, they only have you work with a degree-difference of one.) Content Continues Below To summarize: What is a slant (or oblique) asymptote? Suppose a rational function has a numerator whose degree is exactly 1 greater than the denominator's degree. The slant (or oblique) asymptote for that rational function is a straight (but not horizontal or vertical) line that shows where the graph goes, off to the sides. How do you find the slant (or oblique) asymptote? To find the slant asymptote, do the long division of the numerator by the denominator. The result will be a degree- 2 polynomial part (across the top of the long division) and a proper fractional part (formed by dividing the remainder by the denominattor). The linear polynomial, when set equal to y , is the slant asymptote. What is the difference between slant, horizontal, and vertical asymptotes? Vertical asymptotes are caused by zeroes of the denominator; they indicate where the graph must *never* go, as this would cause division by zero. As a result, they can *never* be touched or crossed. Horizontal asymptotes are caused by the numerator having a degree that is smaller than, or equal to, the degree of the denominator; they indicate where the graph will be when it's off to the sides (away from vertical asymptotes, etc). Horizontal asymptotes can be touched and/or crossed. Slant asymptotes are caused by the numerator having a degree that is 1 greater than that of the denominator; they indicate where the graph will be when it's off to the sides. Slant asymptotes can be touched and/or crossed.

They omitted a linear term in the polynomial on top, and they put the terms in the wrong order underneath. When I'm doing my long division, I'll need to be careful to include the missing linear term in the numerator, and I'll need to keep track of the signs when I reverse the terms in the denominator. − 2 x 2 − 4 x 2 + 0 x − 19 − x 2 + 3 ) 2 x 3 + 4 x 2 + 0 0 0 0 x + 1 9 ‾ 2 x 3 + 4 x 2 − 6 x − 19 ‾ 4 x 2 + 6 x − 1 9 4 x 2 + 6 x − 12 ‾ 6 x + 1 3 \\small{ \\begin{array}{r} -2x^2 - 4 \\phantom{x^2+0x-19} \\\\ -x^2+3 {\\overline{\\smash{\\big)} \\, 2x^3+4x^2+\\vphantom{0^{0^0}}0x+\\phantom{1}9}} \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{2x^3 \\phantom{+4x^2} -6x \\phantom{-19}} \\\\[0.5em] 4x^2+6x-\\phantom{1}9 \\\\[0.5em] \\underline{4x^2 \\phantom{+6x} -12} \\\\[0.5em] 6x+\\phantom{1}3 \\end{array} } − 2 x 2 − 4 x 2 + 0 x − 19 − x 2 + 3 ) 2 x 3 + 4 x 2 + 0 0 0 0 x + 1 9 ​ 2 x 3 + 4 x 2 − 6 x − 19 ​ 4 x 2 + 6 x − 1 9 4 x 2 + 6 x − 12 ​ 6 x + 1 3 ​ The slant asymptote is the polynomial part of the answer; I can ignore the remainder. So my answer is: slant asymptote: y = −2 x − 4 (If you're not comfortable with the long-division part of these exercises, then go back and review now! ) A note for the curious regarding the horizontal and slant asymptote rules.

Now that we have learned the operations on signed numbers, we will use those same rules to solve equations that involve negative numbers. We will also study techniques for solving and graphing inequalities having one unknown. SOLVING EQUATIONS INVOLVING SIGNED NUMBERS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to solve equations involving signed numbers. Example 1 Solve for x and check: x + 5 = 3 Solution Using the same procedures learned in chapter 2, we subtract 5 from each side of the equation obtaining Example 2 Solve for x and check: - 3x = 12 Solution Dividing each side by -3, we obtain Always check in the original equation. Another way of solving the equation 3x - 4 = 7x + 8 would be to first subtract 3x from both sides obtaining -4 = 4x + 8, then subtract 8 from both sides and get -12 = 4x. Now divide both sides by 4 obtaining - 3 = x or x = - 3. First remove parentheses. Then follow the procedure learned in chapter 2. LITERAL EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Identify a literal equation. Apply previously learned rules to solve literal equations. An equation having more than one letter is sometimes called a literal equation . It is occasionally necessary to solve such an equation for one of the letters in terms of the others. The step-by-step procedure discussed and used in chapter 2 is still valid after any grouping symbols are removed. Example 1 Solve for c: 3(x + c) - 4y = 2x - 5c Solution First remove parentheses. At this point we note that since we are solving for c, we want to obtain c on one side and all other terms on the other side of the equation. Thus we obtain Remember, abx is the same as 1abx. We divide by the coefficient of x, which in this case is ab. Solve the equation 2x + 2y - 9x + 9a by first subtracting 2.v from both sides. Compare the solution with that obtained in the example. Sometimes the form of an answer can be changed. In this example we could multiply both numerator and denominator of the answer by (- l) (this does not change the value of the answer) and obtain The advantage of this last expression over the first is that there are not so many negative signs in the answer. Multiplying numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number is a use of the fundamental principle of fractions. The most commonly used literal expressions are formulas from geometry, physics, business, electronics, and so forth. Example 4 is the formula for the area of a trapezoid. Solve for c. A trapezoid has two parallel sides and two nonparallel sides. The parallel sides are called bases. Removing parentheses does not mean to merely erase them. We must multiply each term inside the parentheses by the factor preceding the parentheses. Changing the form of an answer is not necessary, but you should be able to recognize when you have a correct answer even though the form is not the same. Example 5 is a formula giving interest (I) earned for a period of D days when the principal (p) and the yearly rate (r) are known. Find the yearly rate when the amount of interest, the principal, and the number of days are all known. Solution The problem requires solving for r. Notice in this example that r was left on the right side and thus the computation was simpler. We can rewrite the answer another way if we wish. GRAPHING INEQUALITIES OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the inequality symbol to represent the relative positions of two numbers on the number line. Graph inequalities on the number line. We have already discussed the set of rational numbers as those that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. There is also a set of numbers, called the irrational numbers, , that cannot be expressed as the ratio of integers. This set includes such numbers as and so on. The set composed of rational and irrational numbers is called the real numbers. Given any two real numbers a and b, it is always possible to state that Many times we are only interested in whether or not two numbers are equal, but there are situations where we also wish to represent the relative size of numbers that are not equal. The symbols < and > are inequality symbols or order relations and are used to show the relative sizes of the values of two numbers. We usually read the symbol < as \"less than.\" For instance, a < b is read as \"a is less than b.\" We usually read the symbol > as \"greater than.\" For instance, a > b is read as \"a is greater than b.\" Notice that we have stated that we usually read a < b as a is less than b. But this is only because we read from left to right. In other words, \"a is less than b\" is the same as saying \"b is greater than a.\" Actually then, we have one symbol that is written two ways only for convenience of reading. One way to remember the meaning of the symbol is that the pointed end is toward the lesser of the two numbers. The statement 2 < 5 can be read as \"two is less than five\" or \"five is greater than two.\" a < b, \"a is less than bif and only if there is a positive number c that can be added to a to give a + c = b. What positive number can be added to 2 to give 5? In simpler words this definition states that a is less than b if we must add something to a to get b. Of course, the \"something\" must be positive. If you think of the number line, you know that adding a positive number is equivalent to moving to the right on the number line. This gives rise to the following alternative definition, which may be easier to visualize. Example 1 3 < 6, because 3 is to the left of 6 on the number line. We could also write 6 > 3. Example 2 - 4 < 0, because -4 is to the left of 0 on the number line. We could also write 0 > - 4. Example 3 4 > - 2, because 4 is to the right of -2 on the number line. Example 4 - 6 < - 2, because -6 is to the left of -2 on the number line. The mathematical statement x < 3, read as \"x is less than 3,\" indicates that the variable x can be any number less than (or to the left of) 3. Remember, we are considering the real numbers and not just integers, so do not think of the values of x for x < 3 as only 2, 1,0, - 1, and so on. Do you see why finding the largest number less than 3 is impossible? As a matter of fact, to name the number x that is the largest number less than 3 is an impossible task. It can be indicated on the number line, however. To do this we need a symbol to represent the meaning of a statement such as x < 3. The symbols ( and ) used on the number line indicate that the endpoint is not included in the set. Example 5 Graph x < 3 on the number line. Solution Note that the graph has an arrow indicating that the line continues without end to the left. This graph represents every real number less than 3. Example 6 Graph x > 4 on the number line. Solution This graph represents every real number greater than 4. Example 7 Graph x > -5 on the number line. Solution This graph represents every real number greater than -5. Example 8 Make a number line graph showing that x > - 1 and x < 5. (The word \"and\" means that both conditions must apply.) Solution The statement x > - 1 and x < 5 can be condensed to read - 1 < x < 5. This graph represents all real numbers that are between - 1 and 5. Example 9 Graph - 3 < x < 3. Solution If we wish to include the endpoint in the set, we use a different symbol, :. We read these symbols as \"equal to or less than\" and \"equal to or greater than.\" Example 10 x >; 4 indicates the number 4 and all real numbers to the right of 4 on the number line. What does x < 4 represent? The symbols [ and ] used on the number line indicate that the endpoint is included in the set. You will find this use of parentheses and brackets to be consistent with their use in future courses in mathematics. This graph represents the number 1 and all real numbers greater than 1. This graph represents the number 1 and all real numbers less than or equal to - 3. Example 13 Write an algebraic statement represented by the following graph. Example 14 Write an algebraic statement for the following graph. This graph represents all real numbers between -4 and 5 including -4 and 5. Example 15 Write an algebraic statement for the following graph. This graph includes 4 but not -2. Example 16 Graph on the number line. Solution This example presents a small problem. How can we indicate on the number line? If we estimate the point, then another person might misread the statement. Could you possibly tell if the point represents or maybe ? Since the purpose of a graph is to clarify, always label the endpoint. A graph is used to communicate a statement. You should always name the zero point to show direction and also the endpoint or points to be exact. SOLVING INEQUALITIES OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to solve inequalities involving one unknown. The solutions for inequalities generally involve the same basic rules as equations. There is one exception, which we will soon discover. The first rule, however, is similar to that used in solving equations. If the same quantity is added to each side of an inequality , the results are unequal in the same order. Example 1 If 5 < 8, then 5 + 2 < 8 + 2. Example 2 If 7 < 10, then 7 - 3 < 10 - 3. 5 + 2 < 8 + 2 becomes 7 < 10. 7 - 3 < 10 - 3 becomes 4 < 7. We can use this rule to solve certain inequalities. Example 3 Solve for x: x + 6 < 10 Solution If we add -6 to each side, we obtain Graphing this solution on the number line, we have Note that the procedure is the same as in solving equations. We will now use the addition rule to illustrate an important concept concerning multiplication or division of inequalities. Suppose x > a. Now add - x to both sides by the addition rule. Remember, adding the same quantity to both sides of an inequality does not change its direction. Now add -a to both sides. The last statement, - a > -x, can be rewritten as - x < -a. Therefore we can say, \"If x > a, then - x < -a. This translates into the following rule: If an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the results will be unequal in the opposite order. For example: If 5 > 3 then -5 < -3. Example 5 Solve for x and graph the solution: -2x>6 Solution To obtain x on the left side we must divide each term by - 2. Notice that since we are dividing by a negative number, we must change the direction of the inequality. Notice that as soon as we divide by a negative quantity, we must change the direction of the inequality. Take special note of this fact. Each time you divide or multiply by a negative number, you must change the direction of the inequality symbol. This is the only difference between solving equations and solving inequalities. When we multiply or divide by a positive number, there is no change. When we multiply or divide by a negative number, the direction of the inequality changes. Be careful-this is the source of many errors. Once we have removed parentheses and have only individual terms in an expression, the procedure for finding a solution is almost like that in chapter 2. Let us now review the step-by-step method from chapter 2 and note the difference when solving inequalities. First Eliminate fractions by multiplying all terms by the least common denominator of all fractions. (No change when we are multiplying by a positive number.) Second Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the inequality. (No change) Third Add or subtract quantities to obtain the unknown on one side and the numbers on the other. (No change) Fourth Divide each term of the inequality by the coefficient of the unknown. If the coefficient is positive, the inequality will remain the same. If the coefficient is negative, the inequality will be reversed. (This is the important difference between equations and inequalities.) The only possible difference is in the final step. What must be done when dividing by a negative number? Don�t forget to label the endpoint. SUMMARY Key Words A literal equation is an equation involving more than one letter. The symbols < and > are inequality symbols or order relations . a < b means that a is to the left of b on the real number line. The double symbols : indicate that the endpoints are included in the solution set . Procedures To solve a literal equation for one letter in terms of the others follow the same steps as in chapter 2. To solve an inequality use the following steps: Step 1 Eliminate fractions by multiplying all terms by the least common denominator of all fractions. Step 2 Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the inequality. Step 3 Add or subtract quantities to obtain the unknown on one side and the numbers on the other. Step 4 Divide each term of the inequality by the coefficient of the unknown. If the coefficient is positive, the inequality will remain the same. If the coefficient is negative, the inequality will be reversed. Step 5 Check your answer.

Now that we have learned the operations on signed numbers, we will use those same rules to solve equations that involve negative numbers. We will also study techniques for solving and graphing inequalities having one unknown. SOLVING EQUATIONS INVOLVING SIGNED NUMBERS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to solve equations involving signed numbers. Example 1 Solve for x and check: x + 5 = 3 Solution Using the same procedures learned in chapter 2, we subtract 5 from each side of the equation obtaining Example 2 Solve for x and check: - 3x = 12 Solution Dividing each side by -3, we obtain Always check in the original equation. Another way of solving the equation 3x - 4 = 7x + 8 would be to first subtract 3x from both sides obtaining -4 = 4x + 8, then subtract 8 from both sides and get -12 = 4x. Now divide both sides by 4 obtaining - 3 = x or x = - 3. First remove parentheses. Then follow the procedure learned in chapter 2. LITERAL EQUATIONS OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Identify a literal equation. Apply previously learned rules to solve literal equations. An equation having more than one letter is sometimes called a literal equation . It is occasionally necessary to solve such an equation for one of the letters in terms of the others. The step-by-step procedure discussed and used in chapter 2 is still valid after any grouping symbols are removed. Example 1 Solve for c: 3(x + c) - 4y = 2x - 5c Solution First remove parentheses. At this point we note that since we are solving for c, we want to obtain c on one side and all other terms on the other side of the equation. Thus we obtain Remember, abx is the same as 1abx. We divide by the coefficient of x, which in this case is ab. Solve the equation 2x + 2y - 9x + 9a by first subtracting 2.v from both sides. Compare the solution with that obtained in the example. Sometimes the form of an answer can be changed. In this example we could multiply both numerator and denominator of the answer by (- l) (this does not change the value of the answer) and obtain The advantage of this last expression over the first is that there are not so many negative signs in the answer. Multiplying numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number is a use of the fundamental principle of fractions. The most commonly used literal expressions are formulas from geometry, physics, business, electronics, and so forth. Example 4 is the formula for the area of a trapezoid. Solve for c. A trapezoid has two parallel sides and two nonparallel sides. The parallel sides are called bases. Removing parentheses does not mean to merely erase them. We must multiply each term inside the parentheses by the factor preceding the parentheses. Changing the form of an answer is not necessary, but you should be able to recognize when you have a correct answer even though the form is not the same. Example 5 is a formula giving interest (I) earned for a period of D days when the principal (p) and the yearly rate (r) are known. Find the yearly rate when the amount of interest, the principal, and the number of days are all known. Solution The problem requires solving for r. Notice in this example that r was left on the right side and thus the computation was simpler. We can rewrite the answer another way if we wish. GRAPHING INEQUALITIES OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to: Use the inequality symbol to represent the relative positions of two numbers on the number line. Graph inequalities on the number line. We have already discussed the set of rational numbers as those that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. There is also a set of numbers, called the irrational numbers, , that cannot be expressed as the ratio of integers. This set includes such numbers as and so on. The set composed of rational and irrational numbers is called the real numbers. Given any two real numbers a and b, it is always possible to state that Many times we are only interested in whether or not two numbers are equal, but there are situations where we also wish to represent the relative size of numbers that are not equal. The symbols < and > are inequality symbols or order relations and are used to show the relative sizes of the values of two numbers. We usually read the symbol < as \"less than.\" For instance, a < b is read as \"a is less than b.\" We usually read the symbol > as \"greater than.\" For instance, a > b is read as \"a is greater than b.\" Notice that we have stated that we usually read a < b as a is less than b. But this is only because we read from left to right. In other words, \"a is less than b\" is the same as saying \"b is greater than a.\" Actually then, we have one symbol that is written two ways only for convenience of reading. One way to remember the meaning of the symbol is that the pointed end is toward the lesser of the two numbers. The statement 2 < 5 can be read as \"two is less than five\" or \"five is greater than two.\" a < b, \"a is less than bif and only if there is a positive number c that can be added to a to give a + c = b. What positive number can be added to 2 to give 5? In simpler words this definition states that a is less than b if we must add something to a to get b. Of course, the \"something\" must be positive. If you think of the number line, you know that adding a positive number is equivalent to moving to the right on the number line. This gives rise to the following alternative definition, which may be easier to visualize. Example 1 3 < 6, because 3 is to the left of 6 on the number line. We could also write 6 > 3. Example 2 - 4 < 0, because -4 is to the left of 0 on the number line. We could also write 0 > - 4. Example 3 4 > - 2, because 4 is to the right of -2 on the number line. Example 4 - 6 < - 2, because -6 is to the left of -2 on the number line. The mathematical statement x < 3, read as \"x is less than 3,\" indicates that the variable x can be any number less than (or to the left of) 3. Remember, we are considering the real numbers and not just integers, so do not think of the values of x for x < 3 as only 2, 1,0, - 1, and so on. Do you see why finding the largest number less than 3 is impossible? As a matter of fact, to name the number x that is the largest number less than 3 is an impossible task. It can be indicated on the number line, however. To do this we need a symbol to represent the meaning of a statement such as x < 3. The symbols ( and ) used on the number line indicate that the endpoint is not included in the set. Example 5 Graph x < 3 on the number line. Solution Note that the graph has an arrow indicating that the line continues without end to the left. This graph represents every real number less than 3. Example 6 Graph x > 4 on the number line. Solution This graph represents every real number greater than 4. Example 7 Graph x > -5 on the number line. Solution This graph represents every real number greater than -5. Example 8 Make a number line graph showing that x > - 1 and x < 5. (The word \"and\" means that both conditions must apply.) Solution The statement x > - 1 and x < 5 can be condensed to read - 1 < x < 5. This graph represents all real numbers that are between - 1 and 5. Example 9 Graph - 3 < x < 3. Solution If we wish to include the endpoint in the set, we use a different symbol, :. We read these symbols as \"equal to or less than\" and \"equal to or greater than.\" Example 10 x >; 4 indicates the number 4 and all real numbers to the right of 4 on the number line. What does x < 4 represent? The symbols [ and ] used on the number line indicate that the endpoint is included in the set. You will find this use of parentheses and brackets to be consistent with their use in future courses in mathematics. This graph represents the number 1 and all real numbers greater than 1. This graph represents the number 1 and all real numbers less than or equal to - 3. Example 13 Write an algebraic statement represented by the following graph. Example 14 Write an algebraic statement for the following graph. This graph represents all real numbers between -4 and 5 including -4 and 5. Example 15 Write an algebraic statement for the following graph. This graph includes 4 but not -2. Example 16 Graph on the number line. Solution This example presents a small problem. How can we indicate on the number line? If we estimate the point, then another person might misread the statement. Could you possibly tell if the point represents or maybe ? Since the purpose of a graph is to clarify, always label the endpoint. A graph is used to communicate a statement. You should always name the zero point to show direction and also the endpoint or points to be exact. SOLVING INEQUALITIES OBJECTIVES Upon completing this section you should be able to solve inequalities involving one unknown. The solutions for inequalities generally involve the same basic rules as equations. There is one exception, which we will soon discover. The first rule, however, is similar to that used in solving equations. If the same quantity is added to each side of an inequality , the results are unequal in the same order. Example 1 If 5 < 8, then 5 + 2 < 8 + 2. Example 2 If 7 < 10, then 7 - 3 < 10 - 3. 5 + 2 < 8 + 2 becomes 7 < 10. 7 - 3 < 10 - 3 becomes 4 < 7. We can use this rule to solve certain inequalities. Example 3 Solve for x: x + 6 < 10 Solution If we add -6 to each side, we obtain Graphing this solution on the number line, we have Note that the procedure is the same as in solving equations. We will now use the addition rule to illustrate an important concept concerning multiplication or division of inequalities. Suppose x > a. Now add - x to both sides by the addition rule. Remember, adding the same quantity to both sides of an inequality does not change its direction. Now add -a to both sides. The last statement, - a > -x, can be rewritten as - x < -a. Therefore we can say, \"If x > a, then - x < -a. This translates into the following rule: If an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, the results will be unequal in the opposite order. For example: If 5 > 3 then -5 < -3. Example 5 Solve for x and graph the solution: -2x>6 Solution To obtain x on the left side we must divide each term by - 2. Notice that since we are dividing by a negative number, we must change the direction of the inequality. Notice that as soon as we divide by a negative quantity, we must change the direction of the inequality. Take special note of this fact. Each time you divide or multiply by a negative number, you must change the direction of the inequality symbol. This is the only difference between solving equations and solving inequalities. When we multiply or divide by a positive number, there is no change. When we multiply or divide by a negative number, the direction of the inequality changes. Be careful-this is the source of many errors. Once we have removed parentheses and have only individual terms in an expression, the procedure for finding a solution is almost like that in chapter 2. Let us now review the step-by-step method from chapter 2 and note the difference when solving inequalities. First Eliminate fractions by multiplying all terms by the least common denominator of all fractions. (No change when we are multiplying by a positive number.) Second Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the inequality. (No change) Third Add or subtract quantities to obtain the unknown on one side and the numbers on the other. (No change) Fourth Divide each term of the inequality by the coefficient of the unknown. If the coefficient is positive, the inequality will remain the same. If the coefficient is negative, the inequality will be reversed. (This is the important difference between equations and inequalities.) The only possible difference is in the final step. What must be done when dividing by a negative number? Don�t forget to label the endpoint. SUMMARY Key Words A literal equation is an equation involving more than one letter. The symbols < and > are inequality symbols or order relations . a < b means that a is to the left of b on the real number line. The double symbols : indicate that the endpoints are included in the solution set . Procedures To solve a literal equation for one letter in terms of the others follow the same steps as in chapter 2. To solve an inequality use the following steps: Step 1 Eliminate fractions by multiplying all terms by the least common denominator of all fractions. Step 2 Simplify by combining like terms on each side of the inequality. Step 3 Add or subtract quantities to obtain the unknown on one side and the numbers on the other. Step 4 Divide each term of the inequality by the coefficient of the unknown. If the coefficient is positive, the inequality will remain the same. If the coefficient is negative, the inequality will be reversed. Step 5 Check your answer.

Homophones - Video Lesson Examples of Homophones Sentences with Homophones Homophones vs Homographs Homophones Useful for Writing Homophones - Quiz What Is a Homophone? Homophones are two or more words that sound alike but have different meanings, origins, or spellings. Examples of Homophones know, no deer, dear stationery, stationary to, two, too sole, soul hour, our cereal, serial compliment, complement bear, bare, bear hole, whole cell, sell mail, male waist, waste caret, carat, carrot weather, whether Sentences with Homophones Dear-Deer This novel is very dear to Dad. Little Sam saw five deer at the zoo. Son-Sun My son will turn 12 next month. The sun rises in the east. Right-Write Benjamin will write the assignment after lunch. I got five answers right . Two-Too Shawn has read two books on the topic. The dress was too expensive for us to buy. Homophones vs Homographs Both the names \"homographs\" and \"homographs\" are self-explanatory. The word \"graph\" is to do with writing, while \"phone\" denotes sound or pronunciation. Homographs then are words written or spelled the same, but are different in meanings. Homophones, as we have already discussed, sound the same but are different in one of the three things: meanings, origins, and spellings. Example for homograph: bow (a loop made in a string of a ribbon) bow (a device used to shoot arrows) bow (the front of a ship) Click on the Circles to Spot the Six Homophones I'll-isle feet-feat store-stored for-fore bear-bare coming-Cumings sure-sore eight-ate cell-sell duck-dock Reset Homophones Useful for Writing There is no point in just memorizing lots and lots of homographs, but the idea is to carefully master the ones that matter a lot in writing. Here are a few: They're, Their, There They're — This is the contraction of \"they are\". Example: They're coming home after a year. Their — This means \"belonging to the people\". Example: Their hard work has finally paid off. There — This denotes a place or is used with words such as is, are, was, and were. Examples: The building over there is Dad's office. There are two restaurants in our neighborhood. Its, It's The simple thing to remember here is if the word can be replaced with \"it is\" or \"it has\", it is the one with the apostrophe. Or else, it is the one without the apostrophe. \" Its \" means \"belonging to it\". Example: The dog is wagging its tail. \" It's \" means \"it is\" or \"it has\".

Carpenter ants are a species of ant that get their name from the way they build nests, because they excavate wood and form smooth tunnels inside of the wood. They do not eat wood, they only tunnel and chew through it to create nests. Piles of fine sawdust are a clear sign of carpenter ants in the house and a likely need for carpenter ant extermination. What Do Carpenter Ants Look Like? Carpenter ants vary in size and can be anywhere from ½” to ⅝” long. While black carpenter ants are common, you may also find a combination of black and red, red, or brown. What are Signs of Carpenter Ants in the House? The first appearance of winged males in a home often causes homeowners great concern, as it signifies that ants are living inside the house. The presence of a carpenter ant nest is sometimes indicated by a rustling sound that will come from wall voids or from wood where the nest is located when the winged forms are disturbed. If you see one ant, it likely signals you may have an infestation. How Do You Prevent Carpenter Ants? Carpenter ants require a water source to survive. They also like to build nests in stacks of wood and sometimes use branches to get into the home. Some ways you can prevent carpenter ants in the house include: Eliminate sources of moisture or standing water. Keep tree branches and other plants cut back from the house. Seal all cracks or little openings around the bottom of doors or around windows with a silicone-based caulk. Keep firewood and building materials stored away from the home. What are the Signs of a Full Carpenter Ant Infestation in the House? The main signs of a carpenter ant infestation in the house are small openings on the surface of wood. Through these openings, the ants expel debris, which consists of sawdust-like shavings and/or fragments of insulation and/or insect body parts. The accumulation of this debris below the holes is a good indication of an active infestation. The gallery walls that carpenter ants create are smooth, with a sand-papered appearance. Active galleries are kept clean of debris. If you find these signs, contact a pest control professional about carpenter ant extermination immediately. They can cause serious damage to your home if not appropriately dealt with. Do Carpenter Ants Bite? Carpenter ants can bite and have powerful jaws, so their bites can be painful. They may also inject formic acid into the bite wound, creating a burning sensation. However, this pain will subside and does not pose a significant health threat. Carpenter ants can emit formic acid as a defense against other arthropods, but it poses no danger to humans. People who disturb carpenter ant nests or handle them may detect an odor akin to vinegar, which is acetic acid and has a similar smell. If you’ve been bitten by a carpenter ant, and the pinch has broken the skin, immediately clean the wound with soap and water, apply antibiotic ointment, and bandage the wound to prevent infection. Even though carpenter ant bites are very uncommon, its best to contact a pest control professional if you see them, since they can cause serious damage to structures. How Do Carpenter Ants Enter Buildings? Carpenter Ants usually come into buildings through cracks around doors, windows, or through plumbing and electrical penetrations in the home. They will also crawl along overhead wires, shrubs, or tree limbs outdoors that touch the building above ground, then enter the home through any small opening. What Do Carpenter Ants Eat? Carpenter ants feed primarily on insect honeydew, plant and fruit juices, insects and other arthropods. Inside, they will also feed on sweets, eggs, meats, cakes and grease. The workers will forage up to 300 feet from their nest. Although some workers are active during the day, most activity occurs from shortly before dusk until dawn. The reason sawdust is a clear sign of carpenter ants in the house is because they do not actually eat the wood. They only dig holes in the wood to make their nests. What Kind of Wood Do Carpenter Ants Attack? Most species of carpenter ants attack wood that is or has been wet and damaged by mold. They prefer to attack wood softened by fungus, which is often associated with moisture problems, so homeowners should keep an eye out for excess moisture and soft, rotting wood around the home. Even though they first invade wet, decayed wood, they may later begin excavating tunnels through dry, undamaged wood. How Big Are Carpenter Ant Colonies? The western black carpenter ant colony, when mature, contains about 10-20,000 workers, with large colonies of more than 50,000 individuals. There is usually only one functional, wingless queen per colony. Swarmers are not produced until the colony is more than two years old. They are produced in the previous year and held over the winter in the nest for release the following year. Swarmers appear from May until August in the eastern United States and from February through June in the west. Where Do Carpenter Ants Build Their Nests? Carpenter ants build their nests outdoors in various wood sources. This can include: Tree stumps Rotting fence posts Old firewood Under stones The parent colony, or main colony, is typically located outside and contains the queen, eggs and young. Satellite nests can occur and branch out from the main parent colony, and they only contain workers, mature larvae, and pupae. Satellite nests are formed in mid-summer both indoors and outdoors and do not form until the parent colony matures over several years. Usually around August, the workers and winged ants will emerge from the pupae. How Do Carpenter Ants Mate? Carpenter ants will begin mating flights in a process called swarming. Winged males are typically the first to emerge when environmental conditions like temperature and extended daylight signify that it’s time to swarm. If conditions are right, the male releases a pheromone that stimulates the female to leave her nest.
